SP-0	2	0	2	The statement indicates that Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and one brother, who is common to all the daughters. Therefore, there are a total of 8 family members (6 daughters + 1 brother + 2 parents) making it 9 people in the family. This perfectly aligns with the information given, making option 2 the correct explanation.
SP-1	3	0	3	The riddle plays with the words 'shoots', 'holds underwater', and 'hangs' to create a misleading narrative. The woman was actually a photographer who took a picture (shot), then developed it in a darkroom (holding it underwater), and finally hung the photo up to dry, making it a clever play on words rather than an actual crime.
SP-2	2	0	2	The statement mentions that not a single hair on Samuel's head got wet, which implies that he has no hair. The most logical explanation is that he is bald, meaning he has no hair to get wet in the rain.
SP-5	3	0	1	By having two girls share one apple, all five girls can effectively receive an apple, while still leaving one apple in the basket. This scenario satisfies the requirement of each girl getting an apple with one apple remaining in the basket.
SP-6	1	0	1	By sliding a newspaper under a door, Tom and his sister can stand on either side of the newspaper without being able to touch each other, as the door acts as a barrier between them. This effectively keeps them separate while still adhering to the mother's punishment.
SP-7	2	0	2	The horse is able to eat the hay because the rope is not tied to anything else. This means the horse can move freely in the direction of the hay without any restriction, despite the length of the rope.
SP-8	3	0	3	Mrs. Smith has one dog and one cat. When she says 'all of her pets are dogs except one', that refers to the cat, and 'all her pets are cats except one' refers to the dog. Therefore, with one dog and one cat, both statements hold true.
SP-9	1	0	1	The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States are Grover Cleveland, who served two non-consecutive terms. Therefore, he is counted as both the 22nd and the 24th president. This is why they had the same parents but were not brothers; they are in fact the same person.
SP-10	2	0	2	The simplest and most straightforward explanation is that it was not raining, which means none of the girls needed the umbrella at all. Thus, they all remained dry without needing to share the umbrella.
SP-11	1	0	1	The only plausible way the driver could have seen the black dog, given that the street lights were out and it was an intersection painted black, is if it was during the daylight hours. This would provide sufficient natural light for visibility, making it possible for the driver to have spotted the dog in time.
SP-12	1	0	1	The answer is 'It was a Submarine.' A submarine is designed to dive underwater and can appear to sink suddenly, even on a sunny day. Unlike the other options, which do not logically explain why a ship would sink, a submarine naturally submerges into the water, accounting for the sudden 'sinking' observed by spectators.
SP-13	3	0	3	The most logical explanation is that the man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the button for the 15th story normally, but when it rained, he could use his umbrella to press the button for the 20th story, allowing him to access his top-floor apartment.
SP-15	1	0	1	The main reason natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg is that penguins are native to Antarctica and do not inhabit the Arctic region. Therefore, Arctic natives would not encounter penguins or their eggs at all.
SP-17	2	0	2	The explanation states that the wizard brought the rosebush to the woman's home at night and returned her in the morning. During this process, the rosebush that was taken home would not have dew on it in the morning, while the other bushes that remained in the garden would have collected dew overnight. Therefore, the husband could easily identify his wife's rosebush as the only one without dew.
SP-18	2	0	2	In this scenario, the three individuals can be described as one grandfather (who is also a father), one father (who is also a son), and one son (who is the son of the father). With this family structure, there are two fathers (the grandfather and the father) and two sons (the father and the son). Therefore, they can each have one apple, making it possible to distribute the three apples among them.
SP-20	3	0	2	The scenario presented in option 2 cleverly plays with the concept of time rather than literal violence. The man, being a calendar maker, 'killed' February 29th which occurs in a leap year. Therefore, he literally excludes that day from the calendar for that year, causing figurative death to the representation of time for 365 days, as there is no February 29th for that particular leap year. This aligns with the premise of the riddle while not implying actual harm to people.
SP-21	2	0	2	Sally was able to read without artificial light because she is blind and was reading a book by Braille, which allows her to 'read' using her sense of touch rather than sight.
SP-22	1	0	1	In doubles tennis, each team consists of two players, and the total number of sets can be won by each team. Therefore, it is possible for each man to be on a team that wins a total of three sets, while still having played against the other team.
SP-23	3	0	3	The peasant counts only the camels he sees on the ground when he is on one of them. When he counts while riding, he omits to count his own camel. Hence, he counts 29 camels while riding and then counts 30 when he gets off and counts all the camels, including the one he was riding.
SP-24	1	0	1	The statement that John wanted to 'shoot people and blow them up' can be interpreted in a non-violent context when associated with photography. Photographers 'shoot' photos, and some photography can involve dramatic imagery that creates explosive visual effects. The parents' pride suggests they understood his aspirations were artistic, not violent, hence they were supportive despite the seemingly alarming phrasing.
SP-25	2	0	2	The best answer is option 2 because it suggests that Brad opened the window and jumped inside the building, rather than outside. This means he did not actually fall from the 22nd floor but instead leaped into the interior of the office, which would explain why he was completely uninjured.
SP-26	2	0	2	The phrase 'a horse jumps over a tower' can metaphorically refer to the game of chess, where a knight (which is often referred to as a horse) can move over pieces (the tower referring to the rook in chess terminology). This is a playful riddle, and the setting of a chessboard makes sense as it aligns with a logical interpretation of the statement.
SP-27	3	0	3	Dorothy is likely a skydiver or bungee jumper who jumps from high places using safety equipment designed for such activities. Her actions of jumping from heights make her feel better, indicating that this may be a form of thrill-seeking or adrenaline release rather than suicidal behavior. Since she has never been injured, it implies that she is either using proper safety measures or is trained in the activity, which is why she can jump without harm.
SP-28	3	0	2	The description in the brain teaser aligns well with the life cycle of butterflies. During the pupal stage (caterpillar to butterfly), butterflies are not visible as they transform, which could be interpreted as them being 'wiped out.' Eventually, they re-emerge as butterflies, explaining how they can disappear and then reappear without actually being extinct.
SP-29	2	0	2	The key phrase in the riddle is 'not a single man got wet,' which plays on the word 'single.' It implies that all men were married, thus, there were no single men among them. This is a clever wordplay rather than a literal interpretation of their physical state after sinking.
SP-31	1	0	1	The horse operating a mill and moving in a circular path means that the legs on the outside of the circle travel a longer distance than those on the inside. This accounts for the difference in the distance traveled by the horse's legs without suggesting that any of them are actually 'ahead' of the others in a linear sense, thus explaining why two legs would seem to travel further.
SP-32	2	0	2	The man charges towards the train likely because he was on a bridge when he first saw it. Being on a bridge might limit his options for jumping off the track immediately, as he would need to ensure he has a safe exit without falling off the edge or risking injury. This reasoning explains his actions more logically than the other options.
SP-34	2	0	2	The only scenario that logically fits the conditions of the puzzle is that the 5th man was dead and in a coffin. This explains why he did not get wet despite the rain, while the other four men, who were alive and trying to avoid the rain by speeding up, ended up soaked upon arrival.
SP-35	2	0	2	The solution is straightforward because the boat is just one meter from the shore. They can simply step out of the boat and walk onto the shoreline since there is no significant water barrier preventing them from reaching the land.
SP-36	3	0	3	The doctor is the mother of the son. This brain teaser plays on the assumption that doctors are typically male, which is a stereotype. The riddle highlights the need to challenge gender stereotypes and recognize that women can also be doctors.
SP-37	3	0	3	The riddle states that the beggar's brother died, but the beggar has no brother. This suggests that the beggar is female and has a brother who is the one that died. Therefore, the beggar's brother is actually her brother, not directly contradicting the statement that he had no brother, as the beggar is his sister.
SP-38	2	0	2	The riddle describes activities related to dentistry, such as digging out tiny caves (cavities), storing gold and silver (fillings), building bridges (dental bridges), and making crowns (dental crowns). While many people may need dental help, they often fear visiting the dentist due to anxiety or discomfort.
SP-39	2	0	2	The key to the riddle lies in the interpretation of the names. The cowboy can ride into town on a horse named Wednesday. Therefore, he rides into town on Friday (his horse's name), stays for two days (not needing to specify how), and rides out on his horse called Wednesday. This interpretation makes the scenario logically possible.
SP-40	3	0	3	The second door with the lions is the safest choice because if the lions haven't eaten in 5 years, they would have likely died from starvation. Therefore, there would be no immediate threat to you if you opened that door.
SP-41	2	0	1	The statement indicates that 'every single person on board' was killed, which cleverly plays on the term 'single.' This means that all the individuals who were on the plane and were not married (singles) died, but it does not exclude those who were married or those who were not on the plane, thereby allowing for survivors who were not on the flight.
SP-43	2	0	2	The lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, which means it was scheduled for delivery on that specific date the following year. This makes sense in the context of the teaser, as the delay is intentional based on timing rather than an issue with delivery or ingredients.
SP-44	2	0	2	At 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water freezes and turns into ice. Since ice is not a liquid, a steel ball would not fall through it as it would through liquid water. Therefore, the statement about the steel ball falling more rapidly through water is only valid at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, where water is still in liquid form. Thus, option 2 correctly explains why the steel ball falls more rapidly in the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit compared to the scenario at 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
SP-45	3	0	3	The fellow trucker suggested letting some air out of the tires because doing so would lower the height of the truck slightly, potentially allowing it to free itself from being wedged under the overpass. This solution addresses the issue of height, making it the most practical option among the choices.
SP-46	3	0	3	The scenario suggests that the boy was home by the next sunrise but with a full-grown beard, which implies a significant passage of time. Given the context of the locations, the only option that accounts for an extended period without sunlight and would allow for the significant growth of a beard is that he lives in Alaska, where sunrise can occur every six months during certain times of the year. This explains how he could return home after what feels like a short time while having a fully developed beard due to prolonged daylight conditions.
SP-48	1	0	1	The primary reason it is cold on Christmas is that it falls in December, which is winter for many regions around the world. December typically brings colder temperatures, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, thus making option 1 the most logical explanation.
SP-49	1	0	1	The statement specifies that 'Tom and Joe didn't pay.' It indicates that the only remaining person is Wednesday, who is actually a person's name in this context, not the day of the week. Thus, Wednesday is the one who paid for the dinner.
SP-50	1	0	1	The magician could have filled the glass with another substance that does not spill, such as a gel or a different liquid that does not behave like water. Therefore, even though the glass appears to be filled to the top, it could be filled with something other than water, which explains how he dropped it without spilling any.
SP-51	1	0	1	The reasoning behind the lack of mourning and the delight of everyone makes the most sense if Craig and Tracy were hurricanes. Hurricanes can be devastating, and when they die down or change direction (effectively 'dying'), people often feel relief and delight because it means they are safe from potential destruction. Thus, this option fits the context of the hint given in the riddle.
SP-52	3	0	1	Morgan's ability to figure out the amount of lemon juice needed for the apricots relies on her cooking skills and knowledge, rather than her expertise in physics or counting pits. As an excellent chef, she likely understands the proportions required for making apricot jam, including how to measure the lemon juice based on the number of apricots.
SP-53	3	0	3	The woman is a minister, which implies that she has the authority to conduct marriage ceremonies. This means she can legally marry others while herself being in multiple marriages without the need for divorce or separation from her previous spouses, as her role does not require her to comply with the standard legal marital obligations.
SP-54	3	0	3	George was cleaning the inside of the windows, which means he was not stuck on the outside of the building. After the power failure immobilized the hoist, the logical solution for him would be to walk down the stairs to exit the building safely.
SP-55	2	0	2	The woman initially lost the rope worth $3 and gave the man $7 in change, totaling a loss of $10. However, since the $10 bill was counterfeit, she had to pay the clerk with a real $10 bill on top of that, bringing her total loss to $10 (the value of the rope and cash given) plus $3 (for the rope's value), totaling $13. Therefore, the correct answer is that she lost $7 plus the rope, making option 2 the best choice.
SP-56	3	0	3	The two camels were described as facing due East and due West, which inherently means they are directly opposite each other. Hence, they can see each other without any need to change their positions or heads, as they are already oriented towards each other.
SP-57	2	0	2	The sharpshooter hung his hat on the barrel of his gun. When he turned around after walking 100 yards, he was able to shoot directly at the hat because it was on the barrel of the gun, effectively aligning his shot with the hat's position regardless of his blindfold. This clever setup allowed him to successfully shoot through his hat despite being blindfolded.
SP-58	2	0	2	The scenario implies that the dead man used a block of ice to stand on to hang himself. Once he was positioned and the ice melted, it would leave only a puddle of water on the floor, making it appear as though he hung himself without any support or means to do so, which fits the details provided.
SP-61	3	0	3	The truck driver was walking, which means he was not operating the truck while going against the one-way traffic. Pedestrians are allowed to walk in either direction on a one-way street, so he broke no laws.
SP-62	1	0	1	Nolan is unable to read the signs, which suggests a visual impairment. An eye glasses store would be the most relevant option, as it relates directly to her need for vision correction. The other stores (fruit store and bakery) would not specifically address her inability to read signs.
SP-64	2	0	2	The reason he loves being called Batman could be because being a star baseball player brings him a lot of admiration and attention, similar to a superhero. Additionally, a nickname like 'Batman' may resonate with his personality or public persona, making him appreciate it despite his feelings about bats.
SP-65	3	0	3	The only logical explanation is that the secretary is the girl's father. This can happen if the father identifies as a secretary and the woman visiting the bank is the girl’s mother. Thus, the statement 'That little girl was my daughter' can be true from the father's perspective.
SP-66	3	0	2	The explanation that 'the poison need time to dissolve' implies that Maria's drink contained a poison that required a certain amount of time to become lethal. Since Juliana consumed her drinks much faster than Maria, the poison in her drink did not have enough time to dissolve and affect her system, while Maria, who took longer to drink, ingested the fully dissolved poison, leading to her death.
SP-67	2	0	2	The scenario described is a classic puzzle that takes place at the North Pole. When you hire south for 3 miles, then east for 3 miles, and finally north for 3 miles, you end up back at your starting point. The only bears found in the North Pole are polar bears, which are white. Hence, the bear is white.
SP-68	1	0	1	The best answer is that he is a barber. Barbers shave others, thus he can shave people several times a day and still maintain a long beard himself. This option logically explains how he can be seen shaving multiple times without affecting his own beard.
SP-69	3	0	3	The phrase 'took one shot that got them all' is a play on words, suggesting a photographic shot rather than gunfire. Therefore, the correct answer is that the rancher took a panoramic photo of his 500 cows.
SP-70	1	0	1	The only logical explanation for a man to die of old age on his 25th birthday is that he was born on February 29th, a leap year date. This means he would only have a birthday every four years, thus technically celebrating his birthday only 25 times by the time he reached the age commonly associated with old age.
SP-71	1	0	1	The only logical explanation is that Mrs. Adams' son was born on February 29, which is a leap year day. This means he only has a birthday every four years. When he turns 16 today on February 29, he will only celebrate his next birthday, turning 20, in four more years (when he is actually 20), but he will have been alive for 20 years. The other options do not provide a logical explanation.
SP-74	1	0	1	The most plausible explanation is that the river was frozen. This would allow the dog to cross without getting wet, as it would be walking on the ice rather than swimming through water.
SP-75	3	0	3	The key reason for the woman's suspicion is that if the man genuinely believed it was his room, he would not have knocked on the door. Typically, a guest would try to open the door first instead of knocking, suggesting that his behavior was inconsistent with someone who made a mistake about their room number.
SP-77	1	0	1	Sally can wait for the colder months when the lake freezes over, creating a solid surface that allows her to walk across to the island. This is the most logical solution given her lack of transportation and the seasonal weather conditions described.
SP-81	3	0	2	The boy could kick the soccer ball ten feet away from him, and if there is a rope connecting the ball to him, the rope would allow the ball to come back after being kicked. This makes the scenario logically possible compared to the other options.
SP-82	3	0	3	The scenario is possible because the group consists of three people: a grandmother (who is a mother), her daughter (who is both a mother and a daughter), and her daughter's daughter (who is a daughter). This results in two mothers and two daughters, but only three individuals, which explains why only three slices of pizza were eaten.
SP-83	1	0	1	The most straightforward explanation for how the driver knew the man in all black was there is that it was daytime. In this case, visibility would not be a problem, and the driver could see the man regardless of his clothing. The other options might imply situational awareness or attentiveness, but daylight visibility clearly explains the scenario.
SP-84	3	0	3	The third option suggests that there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies, which humorously implies that the quantity is what makes 1968 pennies worth more. While this isn't a factual statement about the actual numismatic value, it plays on the idea of quantity. The other options do not provide valid reasons related to value or market worth.
SP-88	1	0	2	New Year's Day is on January 1st and Christmas is on December 25th. The only time New Year's can come before Christmas in the same year is in a leap year where the New Year's Day follows December 31st of the previous year. The most recent year when New Year's came before Christmas is last year, assuming it is now 2022 (meaning 2021 is last year). In 2021, New Year's came before Christmas that year. Thus, the best answer is last year.
SP-89	1	0	2	If the vice president were to die, the next in line assumes the presidency according to the Presidential Succession Act. The Speaker of the House is next in line after the vice president if both the presidency and vice presidency are vacant, making this option the correct answer.
SP-91	1	0	1	The riddle refers to the number of letters in the word 'three' rather than the number of letters in the names of the months. The word 'three' has five letters, implying that all months have this many letters in their names when considering the phrase 'how many have three' as a play on words.
SP-92	3	0	3	Sandy could be referring to an 'ocean' depicted on a map, which is a representation that doesn't contain actual water. This is a common phenomenon as maps often display oceans and lakes without the physical presence of water.
SP-93	2	0	2	The only logical explanation for the cat not having a single hair wet after getting soaked in the rain is that it was a hairless cat. Since it doesn't have any fur, there would be no hair to get wet.
SP-94	3	0	3	The statement mentions that 'both got to the south side of the river,' which implies that one of the men was already on the south side before the crossing. This means the other man did not need to use the boat to reach the south side, making this option the most logical explanation.
SP-95	3	0	3	The statement specifies that the girl went over to the U.S. on the 4th of July and came back on the 4th of July, suggesting a play on words involving a boat named 'July 4.' This allows her to technically leave and return on the same date, despite being away for 3 days. Options 1 and 2 do not provide a logical way for her to achieve this specific timeline.
SP-96	3	0	1	Since there are 8 brothers and the activities listed focus on various actions from 1 to 7, it suggests that Brother 8 might be doing something that hasn’t been mentioned. Given that Brother 7 is asleep and there are no other sleeping brothers mentioned, it’s logical that Brother 8 is also asleep as they would not be participating in the ongoing activities.
SP-97	3	0	3	The man lived in a lighthouse, and forgetting to turn on the light would have dire consequences, such as a ship crashing due to not being guided safely. This would lead him to deep self-blame because his responsibility was to ensure the safety of ships passing by.
SP-98	3	0	3	David's birthday is in December, which is during the summer season in Australia. Therefore, even though his birthday falls in December, it is never in winter for him.
SP-99	2	0	2	The scenario describes a player who scored not just a hat trick (three goals) but a fourth goal, which upset his teammates. This indicates that the player scored the fourth goal in the wrong net, meaning he scored an own goal. This would understandably lead to frustration from his teammates, as scoring in their own goal would contribute negatively to the game.
SP-100	2	0	2	The two girls can be sisters who were born at the same hour and day but in different years. For example, one could be born on December 31st and the other on January 1st of the following year, making them non-twins despite being born at the same time of day.
SP-101	1	0	3	The man can see his own footstep in the sand because of the reflection from the water. The surface of the water can act like a mirror, allowing him to see his footsteps without having to turn back. The other options do not provide a plausible explanation for how he could see his footprints clearly.
SP-102	1	0	1	The best answer is that they can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave. This suggests that the cave is open to the outside and there is light available, which allows them to find their way out without needing a light source inside the cave.
SP-103	2	0	2	The term 'doctor' can refer to individuals who hold a doctoral degree in any field, not just medicine. Therefore, the woman's sons can be considered doctors because they have achieved a doctoral level of education in their respective academic disciplines rather than being medical doctors who attended medical school.
SP-104	1	0	1	The most logical explanation is that the well is dry. If there is no water in the well, then even though the girl slipped and fell into it, she wouldn't get wet.
SP-105	3	0	3	The statement describes a scenario where a 'stone' produces fruit. In botany, the term 'stone' often refers to the hard pit found in fruits like cherries and peaches that contains the seed. Therefore, if the 'stone' is actually a seed (specifically a cherry stone), then it is indeed possible for it to be buried in the ground, grow, and eventually bear fruit.
SP-107	2	0	2	Roosters are male chickens and do not lay eggs. Therefore, the scenario described is impossible, and the question of which side the egg would roll on is moot. This option directly addresses the fundamental mistake in the premise.
SP-108	1	0	1	The question states that it is a single-story house, which means that there are no stairs. Therefore, option 1 is the correct answer.
SP-109	2	0	2	The scenario can be explained by the fact that there are three individuals: a grandfather (the father), his son (the second father), and his grandson (the son). Therefore, there are two fathers (the grandfather and father) and two sons (the father and grandson) present, which allows for just three fish to be enough for each person to have one.
SP-110	1	0	1	The bus driver didn't break any traffic laws because he was walking, not driving. Therefore, none of the traffic signs and laws applied to him as a pedestrian.
SP-111	3	0	3	The shopkeeper did not lie because the sign said the parrot repeats everything it hears. If the parrot was deaf, it would not have heard anything to repeat, explaining why it didn't say a word. The phrase 'repeats everything it hears' is technically accurate as the parrot likely did not hear anything at all.
SP-112	3	0	1	If you bring another man back with you, you initially leave the room with two legs (your own) and return with six legs (your two legs plus the two legs of the other man, totaling four, and if you consider the legs of any additional items like chairs being returned or figurative legs, it could lead to the interpretation of having six). This option creatively fits the riddle's requirement.
SP-113	2	0	1	The question specifically asks how many months have 28 days. February is the only month that has 28 days in a common year. All other months have either 30 or 31 days. Therefore, the correct answer is that only February has 28 days.
SP-114	2	0	2	The scenario describes two students who share the same birthday, but this does not imply they were born in the same year. They could have been born on the same day and month but in different years, making it possible for them to attend the same school and have the same teacher without being siblings.
SP-115	2	0	2	The scenario describes a man whose suit was torn, and since he died three minutes later, the most logical explanation is that he was an astronaut on a space walk. In space, a torn suit would expose him to the vacuum and harsh conditions, leading to a rapid loss of life due to lack of oxygen and pressure. This aligns with the context provided, whereas the other options do not reasonably explain an immediate death following a torn suit.
SP-116	3	0	3	Standing back to back allows both individuals to be in a position where one is physically behind the other, satisfying the condition of each standing behind the other.
SP-118	1	0	1	The best answer is that the driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours. In this scenario, with all electricity out including street lights and no moonlight, it would be nearly impossible to see anything in complete darkness. The presence of daylight would explain how the driver was able to see the young boy dressed in black despite the lack of any other light sources.
SP-119	2	0	2	The cars can all go forward safely if they all make right-hand turns. At a four-way stop, making a right turn allows each car to proceed without crossing paths with the others, thus avoiding a collision.
SP-124	1	0	3	The man can be 33 years old in the present year because he was born on February 29th, a leap year date that only occurs once every four years. This means he only officially celebrates his birthday every four years, making it possible for him to be counted as 33 years old while being considered 'still alive' due to having celebrated his birthday fewer times.
SP-125	1	0	1	The reason the policeman did not give him a ticket is likely because the man was on a motorcycle. Motorcycles can often have only two wheels on the pavement while negotiating a corner, which is a normal and legal maneuver in such vehicles. The other options do not provide a plausible reason for the lack of a ticket.
SP-126	2	0	2	The riddle describes a situation where four men played all night and ended up with different scores but none of them lost money, which creates a paradox. The answer is that they were musicians, as they likely played music together, earning money through their performance. This means they could all gain from their activity without any losing, as it wasn't a competitive game in terms of betting or gambling, but rather a collaborative effort that generated income for all involved.
SP-127	3	0	3	Johnny could cross the bridge with all three pieces of gold by juggling them. This way, at no point was he carrying the full weight of the three kilograms of gold while on the bridge. Since he is a clown, this juggling ability is plausible, and it allows him to manage his weight effectively without exceeding the bridge's maximum capacity.
