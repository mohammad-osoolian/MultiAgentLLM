SP-0_CR	1	0	1	The scenario is possible because all five players can have the same coach. This means there is one coach shared by all five players, resulting in only six participants (five players + one coach).
SP-1_CR	1	0	1	The statement can be interpreted in a non-violent way if the woman is a photographer, as 'shooting' can refer to taking pictures instead of using a firearm. Therefore, she could be shooting with a camera at people in the park, which would explain how no one gets harmed.
SP-2_CR	3	0	3	If Tom is bald, he has no hair to dry after a shower, which makes it possible for him to never dry his hair. The other options don't logically explain why he wouldn't dry his hair despite being a clean freak.
SP-5_CR	2	0	2	The scenario allows for all seven sorcerers to receive a bean while still leaving one in the vase by handing the final bean to the seventh sorcerer without removing it from the vase. This unique distribution means six sorcerers each receive one bean, while the seventh sorcerer has the bean still in the vase, fulfilling the requirement of leaving one bean in the vase.
SP-6_CR	3	0	2	The explanation provided in option 2 suggests that the mat was folded in multiple times, creating a special shape that allows the couple to be positioned together on it but not facing each other directly. This scenario supports the idea that they could be on the same mat while still not able to visually engage due to the mat's form, making it the best answer.
SP-7_CR	3	0	3	The best explanation for how the boat ended up in the middle of the ocean is that the station wasn't fixed in the marina, allowing the boat to drift away. If the station were not anchored securely, it could have moved in response to currents or waves, taking the boat along with it, leading to the owner finding it far from the marina.
SP-8_CR	3	0	3	Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car, meaning he has two cars total, one of which is red and one of which is blue. Therefore, it is true that all but one of his cars are red (the blue car) and all but one are blue (the red car). This setup adequately explains the stated conditions without introducing additional cars or complexities.
SP-9_CR	3	0	3	The statement indicates that the first and fifth national basketball champions share the same parents but are not brothers. This is possible if the first and fifth champions are actually the same person. Thus, the best explanation is that the first coach and the fifth coach are the same man, making them not brothers but still having the same parents.
SP-10_CR	1	0	1	The reason none of the eight people got hit by falling leaves is that it was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves. In winter, many trees lose their leaves, making it impossible for leaves to fall on the people sitting under it.
SP-11_CR	2	0	2	The couple managed to prevent being crushed because it was during the daylight hours. If it was daytime, they wouldn't need additional visibility from moonlight or their eyes adapting to low-light conditions, as natural sunlight would provide adequate visibility for driving safely.
SP-12_CR	2	0	2	The phrase 'the ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed' suggests that it is an object that can sink but is not at risk due to pressure from water, which fits the characteristics of a submarine. Submarines are designed to operate underwater and can sink intentionally without being crushed due to their structural integrity and ability to manage buoyancy. This explains why the teams on board would not perceive a threat, as this act is controlled and expected in their operations.
SP-13_CR	1	0	1	The old man may not be able to reach the button because he is too old to use his crutch to ascend, but he can still use the crutch as an extension to help him reach the higher buttons in the elevator. The suggestion implies that he possesses the means to aid himself with the crutch for that purpose, unlike the woman who is presumably shorter and unable to press the button herself, thus leading to the conclusion that option 1 is the most plausible explanation.
SP-15_CR	2	0	2	The primary reason a man living in New York City would never drink from the Mississippi River is that the river does not flow through New York City. Therefore, he would not have access to its water regardless of conditions such as drought. The other options are less relevant to the situation presented in the teaser.
SP-17_CR	2	0	2	The lack of dew on the radishes indicates that they were not freshly harvested that morning, suggesting they could not have come from the farmer's own farm. This evidence contradicts the farmer's claim, providing reasonable grounds for the police to detain him despite his assertion.
SP-18_CR	1	0	1	This option correctly explains the situation where there are only three individuals: one grandmother, one mother, and one daughter. The grandmother is the mother of the mother, and the mother is the mother of the daughter. Therefore, even though the group consists of two mothers and two daughters, they can be represented by just three people, which is why the agent only provided three forms.
SP-20_CR	3	0	3	The best answer is that he lived in a light house. Lighthouses are designed to have bright lights to guide ships at night, and it is expected for them to be illuminated. Therefore, the neighbors would not complain because it is a normal occurrence for a lighthouse to have such a bright light.
SP-21_CR	3	0	2	Jessica was able to read a chapter before bed because it was still daytime and there was sufficient natural light for her to see the text, negating the need for candles or artificial light.
SP-22_CR	1	0	1	In this scenario, each of the four players is part of a team, and since they are playing in pairs, the two teams can each win two rounds. This way, each player can have two wins while playing as part of a team. Thus, it is possible for all four players to have won twice in total as a result of their teamwork.
SP-23_CR	2	0	2	The host himself wearing a hat and forgetting to count it explains why he would only tally 29 hats instead of 30. While all participants had unique hats, the host's own hat was an addition that went uncounted, leading to the discrepancy in his tally.
SP-24_CR	1	0	1	Laura's intention to 'slice, dice, and gut for a living' uses terminology that is commonly associated with cooking or food preparation. However, in the context of her career aspirations, it is a playful way of describing the work of a surgeon, who performs operations that involve cutting into bodies. Her parents likely found pride and excitement in the idea that she wanted to pursue such a challenging and respected profession in medicine, which is why they were enthusiastic despite the unusual description.
SP-25_CR	3	0	3	Lily was overwhelmed with fatigue and opened the balcony door to step inside, not outside. Therefore, she did not actually step off the edge of the building, which explains how she was unscathed. This option directly addresses the scenario given in the question.
SP-26_CR	2	0	2	The scenario described resembles a chess game where a chess piece (the tower, which represents the rook) can move to another position and capture an opponent's piece, causing it to 'vanish' from the board. This is a logical explanation for the situation outlined, as it reflects an actual event in a game rather than a physical phenomenon that would occur in the other locations.
SP-27_CR	1	0	1	Matthew is likely a deep-sea diver, which means his dives are planned, controlled, and undertaken in a safe environment. His repeated visits to this deep spot suggest he is familiar with the conditions and has the necessary skills and equipment to dive safely. This is why he has never been injured despite the apparent risks of plunging into deep water. Instead of endangering himself, diving allows him to alleviate stress and enjoy the underwater experience.
SP-28_CR	3	0	3	The best answer is the Mule because mules are indeed sterile and cannot reproduce, which aligns perfectly with the statement of having parents but no children. Mules are hybrids that come from a donkey and a horse, and they cannot give birth, hence they live happily without the ability to have offspring.
SP-29_CR	3	0	3	The riddle plays on the ambiguity of the word 'single.' The correct interpretation of the question is that not a 'single' woman is sunburnt, meaning all the women are married, hence 'not single.' This clever wordplay leads to the humorous conclusion that their marital status is why they did not get sunburnt, as opposed to the physical condition of their skin or a temporary weather change.
SP-31_CR	1	0	1	The man ran in a circular clockwise direction around his apartment, which means that his left leg (the one on the outer side of the circle) had to work harder and travel a greater distance compared to his right leg (the one on the inner side). This consistent extra effort resulted in more muscle development in the left leg, explaining the disparity in muscle growth despite him being normal and healthy.
SP-32_CR	1	0	2	By sprinting towards the bear, the woman reduces the risk of the bear catching her. Grizzly bears can run very fast and if she moved directly away from the bear, it could have estimated her running speed and caught up to her more easily. By closing the distance initially, she may confuse or deter the bear, giving her a better chance to escape safely after stepping off the path.
SP-34_CR	2	0	2	The riddle suggests that while the six women are mentioned, the sixth woman is not actually present in the hiking scenario but is instead a photograph carried by one of the other women. This allows all five women to be cold from the snowfall while still reaching the cabin 'together' with the sixth woman figuratively represented by the photo.
SP-35_CR	2	0	2	The man fell into a 1-meter-deep pool, which is not deep enough to prevent him from standing up. Since he cannot swim but can stand, he was able to safely get back on his feet and exit the pool without needing to rely on swimming or waiting for water levels to change.
SP-36_CR	1	0	1	The statement 'Tom cannot take exam under my supervise as he is my son' suggests that the teacher is speaking from a personal relationship to Tom, indicating that she is his mother. In this scenario, the reason Tom is asked to switch to another room is that he cannot take the exam under the supervision of his own parent, which aligns with option 1.
SP-37_CR	3	0	3	The statement mentions that the police has a brother who passed away, but it specifies that the dead man had no brother. This is possible if the police officer is female, making her a sister rather than a brother. Hence, it aligns with the clue in the riddle.
SP-38_CR	1	0	1	The riddle describes something that breaks down walls (rusting and corrosion), devours towers (metaphorically referring to the destruction caused by rust and degradation of buildings), consumes iron and corrodes steel (which refers to oxygen causing rust), and highlights its essential nature to life (oxygen is essential for respiration). The notion that people desire but fear it could refer to the controlled use of oxygen in combustion or the destructive potential of fire, produced when oxygen fuels it. Therefore, the answer is oxygen.
SP-39_CR	1	0	1	The answer hinges on a play on words. If the airplane is named 'Tuesday,' then the pilot could take off on Tuesday and land on Tuesday again after flying for 48 hours. This is a clever use of language rather than a literal scenario involving time zones or flight duration.
SP-40_CR	1	0	1	The most logical explanation is that the tiger, having been deprived of food for an entire year, would have died from starvation. Therefore, when the bishop was imprisoned in the same cell as the dead tiger, he would be completely unharmed. This scenario makes the most sense considering the circumstances provided.
SP-41_CR	3	0	3	The statement suggests that there are no single individuals at the party, meaning everyone else is married. Therefore, the party is still lively with singing (possibly from couples singing together), while Tom, being single, is the only one without a partner. This scenario makes sense of why the party is filled with singing despite there being no single person present.
SP-43_CR	2	0	2	The question implies that the man arrives in the next century due to a timing factor rather than an actual time travel event. Boarding the plane on New Year's Eve and landing after midnight on New Year's Day would indeed mean he arrived at the start of the next century (if it's a transition from 1999 to 2000, for example). This option directly explains how he could land in the next century while remaining within the realm of reality.
SP-44_CR	3	0	3	At 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water freezes and turns into ice. This means that the kids could stand on top of the ice formed on the water's surface, making it possible for them to 'stand on the water' at that temperature. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for standing on water at that temperature.
SP-45_CR	1	0	1	Deflating the kayak slightly would reduce its size and allow Mary to navigate through the narrow passage. This is a practical solution to her problem, as she cannot paddle backward and needs to make her kayak smaller to fit through the constricted area.
SP-46_CR	3	0	3	The scenario describes a situation where the man plants a flower at sunrise and returns by moonrise, which suggests a long duration. In Alaska, during certain times of the year, there can be prolonged periods of daylight and darkness, meaning that time can stretch over multiple hours or even days without a typical night/day cycle. Thus, it is possible for the flower to wither and fall before he returns due to the extreme length of time he was away.
SP-48_CR	3	0	3	Independence Day is celebrated on July 4th, and July is typically one of the hottest months in the United States. Therefore, the most logical reason for why Independence Day is hot is due to the time of year it is celebrated, as seasonal temperatures contribute significantly to the heat.
SP-49_CR	2	0	2	The statement mentions that Friday is a person's name, indicating there are three people at the table: Jason, Kobe, and Friday. This option logically explains why three sets of knives and forks would be provided, as each person would need their own set.
SP-50_CR	2	0	2	The reason no wine leaked from the glass is that there was no wine in it to spill. This directly explains the scenario without needing further assumptions about the weight of the glass or surface tension.
SP-51_CR	3	0	3	The statement mentions that 'Morgan is dying near the sea line' which can be interpreted as a hurricane reaching its end, causing destruction. If Morgan is a hurricane, then the witnesses are not feeling sad because hurricanes are natural events that are expected and do not evoke emotional responses like the death of a person would. Therefore, option 3 provides a logical explanation for why no one feels sad.
SP-52_CR	3	0	1	Emma's ability to figure out how much cinnamon to add is related to her skills and knowledge in cooking. An excellent chef would know how to measure and adjust ingredients based on the quantity of the main ingredient, in this case, peaches. The other options do not relate directly to the cooking process.
SP-53_CR	1	0	1	The most logical explanation is that the woman is a surrogate mother. This means she could give birth to children without ever having been pregnant herself, as she is carrying and delivering the children for another individual or couple. The other options do not directly relate to the scenario of giving birth legally without pregnancy.
SP-54_CR	2	0	2	Jack was fixing a leaky pipe inside the apartment and was not trapped. Since the issue was with the plumbing shutdown affecting the elevator, he could simply use the stairs to exit the building.
SP-55_CR	2	0	3	The woman lost the perfume (valued at $5.00) and gave out a real $20 bill to the baker after finding out the first bill was counterfeit. In total, she lost $20 (the real amount given to the baker) + $5 (the cost of the perfume), which equals $25. Therefore, the total loss is $25.
SP-56_CR	2	0	2	The only feasible way for both lighthouses, which are fixed facing opposite directions, to illuminate the same ship is if the ship is positioned exactly in between them. This placement allows the beams of light from both lighthouses to reach the same point simultaneously.
SP-57_CR	3	0	3	The pilot was able to fly through the ring while blindfolded because he attached the ring to the front of his plane before obscuring his vision. This means he could simply fly straight ahead and pass through the ring without needing to see it.
SP-58_CR	1	0	2	The clue about the abandoned pack of balloons suggests the possibility of helium or another gas that could be toxic if inhaled. This points to the woman potentially having committed suicide by inhaling the toxic substance from the balloon. Other options do not sufficiently explain the circumstances surrounding her death, particularly the absence of struggle or other footprints.
SP-61_CR	1	0	1	The man could enter the ladies-only club because he was a security guard, which typically allows him access for professional duties. This scenario adheres to the rules of the club, as security personnel often have permission to enter for the safety and monitoring of patrons.
SP-62_CR	3	0	3	Emily is likely in a clock store because it is the most logical place to find out the time. While cafes and bakeries may have clocks, a clock store specializes in timepieces, making it the optimal location for her to learn what time it is.
SP-64_CR	1	0	1	The nickname 'Lightning' suggests speed, which aligns with being a professional sprinter. Although he is afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology, the name represents his athletic prowess, which brings him delight when others refer to him as 'Lightning.'
SP-65_CR	1	0	1	The coach of the team is the boy's mother, which explains why the boy can be the son of both the man and the coach. This riddle often highlights the stereotype that coaches are male, demonstrating that the mother can also be a coach.
SP-66_CR	3	0	3	The scenario describes Juliana finishing five drinks while Maria only finished one. When Juliana returns, the drinks have new liquid, which is explained by the ice in the drinks melting and adding water to the drinks. This is a natural occurrence when drinks are served with ice, as they gradually melt and increase the volume of liquid present.
SP-67_CR	3	0	1	The explorer's movement forms a square path: 3 miles south, 3 miles east, and then 3 miles north. For her to return to her starting point after these movements, she must be at the South Pole. Walking 3 miles south from the South Pole will take her directly south to the latitude line, then walking east will keep her at the same latitude, and walking 3 miles north will bring her back to the South Pole.
SP-68_CR	1	0	1	A coach is someone who is involved with a football team on a daily basis without necessarily playing the sport themselves. They train players, devise strategies, and manage the team's performance, which aligns perfectly with the statement that a man goes to a football team every day but doesn't play football.
SP-69_CR	3	0	3	The woman is using a camera to take photographs, which is often referred to as 'shooting' in photography. Hence, she is not posing any real threat to the people in the park, and no one is harmed.
SP-70_CR	1	0	1	John's birthday being on February 29th means he only has a birthday every four years, making it less prominent in the yearly calendar. This could lead to it being overlooked compared to other family members, which aligns with the scenario of no one mentioning it.
SP-71_CR	1	0	1	He was born on February 29, which means he only has a birthday every four years. As a result, he technically hasn't had a birthday celebration or received presents for three years since the most recent one would have been in the leap year.
SP-74_CR	1	0	1	The most logical explanation in this scenario is that the river was frozen, allowing the man to walk across the ice instead of needing to swim or use a raft. The other options involve either taking a detour or jumping, which seem less plausible given the context of the situation.
SP-75_CR	3	0	3	The hiker became suspicious of the man because if he had genuinely taken the wrong trail, a reasonable person would typically ask for directions or consult a map instead of just sheepishly saying 'wrong trail' and leaving. This behavior indicates a lack of genuine intent or knowledge, which raises the hiker's suspicions.
SP-77_CR	1	0	1	Using a sled during heavy snowfall is the most practical solution for transporting construction materials and furniture to the remote plateau. Snow can create a natural pathway that allows for easier movement, and sleds are specifically designed to glide over snow, making them ideal for this scenario. The other options do not address the logistical challenges posed by the lack of roads in a snowy mountainous region.
SP-81_CR	2	0	2	The scenario where the pitcher throws the baseball up allows the ball to come back down due to gravity. When a ball is thrown straight up, it will rise, slow down, stop momentarily at its peak, and then fall back down to the pitcher, making it seem like it returned to him after being thrown 1 mile high in the air.
SP-82_CR	3	0	3	The situation can be explained by the fact that there are three people in total: a grandmother (who is also a mother), her daughter (who is also a mother), and her daughter's daughter (who is a daughter). This means there are indeed two mothers and two daughters present, but only three individuals. Therefore, they can equally split the $21 among them.
SP-83_CR	3	0	3	The scenario describes a girl falling into a 60-foot well but not getting wet, which suggests that there is no water at the bottom of the well. Therefore, the well must be dry, making option 3 the correct answer.
SP-84_CR	1	0	1	The value of 1990 dollars being higher than 1989 dollars can be interpreted from a financial perspective where inflation typically causes the value of money to change over time. In 1990, there is an additional dollar (1990) which could symbolize an increase in nominal monetary value or purchasing power compared to 1989 (1989). Options 2 and 3 are not relevant to the value of money in economic terms.
SP-88_CR	2	0	2	New Year's Day always comes before Christmas Day in every year of the calendar. New Year's is celebrated on January 1st, while Christmas is celebrated on December 25th of the same year, making it a consistent fact across all years.
SP-89_CR	2	0	1	In the absence of the vice captain, the first officer is typically next in line to take command of the ship. The captain remains in charge, but if the vice captain departs from their role, it is the first officer's responsibility to assume the duties of command until the vice captain's position is filled or reinstated.
SP-92_CR	1	0	1	Sandy could be referring to a representation of a forest on a map, where forests can appear devoid of leaves as maps do not depict foliage, making this statement truthful.
SP-93_CR	3	0	1	The most logical explanation for why not a single snowflake landed on his hair is that the man succeeded in avoiding all snowflakes. This implies active movement or positioning that kept him from being hit by any snowflakes, rather than relying on conditions or characteristics like the weather changing or being bold.
SP-94_CR	3	0	3	The statement 'One person is already at the top of the hill' implies that one of the two individuals did not need to use the motorcycle to reach the top, as they were already there. This allows both of them to be considered as having reached the top without the need for the motorcycle to be shared or used by both.
SP-95_CR	2	0	2	The boy was able to return on May 1 because he flew to Japan on a flight that was named 'May 1'. This option cleverly plays with the idea that the date of his return is not influenced by the actual days spent at the festival, and he could have left on May 1 but returned home on a flight with the same name.
SP-96_CR	3	0	3	Friend 5 is likely playing hide and seek, as that is the only remaining activity that hasn't been mentioned for the other friends. Since Friend 1 is already involved in the game of hide and seek, it makes sense that Friend 5 is also participating in the same activity.
SP-97_CR	3	0	3	The man lived in a lighthouse, and it is essential for lighthouses to have lights on at all times to guide ships safely. Therefore, his boss wouldn't blame him for wasting electricity since it is necessary for his work in ensuring maritime safety.
SP-98_CR	2	0	2	David's birthday is never in the summer because he lives in Australia, where the seasons are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere. While June is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter in Australia, which explains why his birthday is never in the summer.
SP-99_CR	2	0	2	The player from Team One scored two goals, but if they scored in their own goal, this would count as points for Team Two. Since Team One lost the game, this is likely the reason, as they would essentially have scored points for the opposing team.
SP-100_CR	3	0	3	The two friends had their calendars marked for the same restaurant at the same hour, day, and month but in different years. This means they could have the same date marked but they are not meeting because they are in different years. The other options do not adequately explain how they did not cross paths despite having the same calendar entry.
SP-101_CR	3	0	3	The most plausible explanation is that she was moving backwards while making the snow angel. If she made the snow angel while moving backward, she would still be able to see the angel without turning around since she hasn't physically turned her body to face it. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for how she could see the angel without turning around.
SP-102_CR	2	0	2	The key detail in the riddle is that the town is painted black and the street lights are not working, making it dark due to the storm. However, if it is daytime, there would be enough natural light for the driver to see the black dog in the intersection, regardless of the damaged headlights. Hence, the most logical explanation is that it was daytime.
SP-103_CR	3	0	3	The statement refers to Johnson being a 'doctor' in the academic sense, which means he could hold a doctoral degree in a field such as philosophy, education, or another discipline unrelated to medicine. This is why he can be considered a famous doctor who benefits mankind without having attended medical school.
SP-104_CR	2	0	2	The boy didn't get wet because the pool was empty. If there is no water in the pool, walking into it wouldn't result in getting wet, regardless of its depth.
SP-105_CR	1	0	1	The best answer is that the stones were actually seeds, as the term 'stones' can refer to cherry pits or similar seeds. Therefore, while they hit the other farmer, they could not cause any harm, leading to the outcome described in the riddle.
SP-107_CR	1	0	1	Roosters are male chickens and do not lay eggs; only hens, which are female chickens, are capable of producing eggs. Therefore, it is entirely conceivable that a farmer who only has roosters would receive no eggs, as there would be no hens to lay them.
SP-108_CR	1	0	1	A one-story house, by definition, does not have a basement. Therefore, the question of the color of a basement is irrelevant as there is simply no basement in a one-story structure.
SP-109_CR	1	0	1	This option is logical because it suggests that one of the employees is also a boss to someone else outside of the meeting. Therefore, there can still be two bosses (one being the manager and the other being a boss to another set of employees) and two employees (one being the deputy to the boss and the other being in charge of someone else). Thus, they can be discussing three different tasks among them.
SP-110_CR	2	0	2	The clue lies in the phrasing 'he was just walking down the street.' This implies that he was not currently committing a theft. Since he had stolen from others previously and was not actively being suspicious at that moment, it explains why no one was catching him. Additionally, the people he stole from may not have noticed him or recognized him as the thief at that moment.
SP-111_CR	1	0	1	The first option suggests that the man was blind, which explains why he couldn't follow his boss's demonstrations. If he was unable to see what was being shown to him, he would indeed need explicit verbal instructions rather than visual demonstrations to understand what to do. This scenario aligns with the fact that he was not doing what he was shown, as he couldn't see it.
SP-112_CR	2	0	2	This option makes sense because you can leave your office on your two legs and come back while carrying a dog in your arms. This means you still have your two legs, just that you are holding the dog instead of having it walk on its own.
SP-113_CR	1	0	1	The statement 'They all do' implies that all animals mentioned (those with four legs and those with two) can be interpreted as having a single leg in a metaphorical or illustrative sense (like a leg on a table, a limb of some kind, or even in a humorous context). The other options incorrectly define specific categories of animals that don't actually exist as described.
SP-114_CR	3	0	3	The most plausible explanation is that they were living in different periods of time and both working in that store. This scenario allows for them to never see each other, even if they worked the same shift and had the same tasks. In contrast, options 1 and 2 suggest distractions or busyness, which would not prevent them from seeing each other in the same physical space.
SP-115_CR	2	0	2	Option 2 presents a plausible scenario where the man's injury attracted a shark, leading directly to his death. This explanation aligns with the idea that the small amount of blood could have drawn a predator, resulting in an immediate and painful demise. The other options suggest psychological or physiological reactions, but they don't provide a direct cause of death linked to the injury in the context of swimming in the sea.
SP-116_CR	2	0	2	The scenario describes a situation where two men are hanging from a horizontally set ladder, allowing them to move towards each other from opposite ends. This physical arrangement makes it possible for them to approach one another without actually passing, as they are not occupying the same space on the ladder itself. Options 1 and 3 do not provide a clear explanation for why they cannot pass each other.
SP-118_CR	3	0	3	The crew were not cruising in the sea implies that they were likely safe on land or in a stable environment, such as a harbor or dock, which would explain why they could remain comfortable and warm despite the stormy weather conditions outside.
SP-119_CR	2	0	3	If there was no food on the table to begin with, then everyone could take from everyone's plate without affecting the total amount of food available. Thus, even though they were stealing from each other's plates, they all ended up having eaten the same amount because there simply was no food for them to miss out on. This ensures that they are not hungry despite taking from each other.
SP-124_CR	3	0	3	The phrase 'Italy was the name of the restaurant he was celebrating his birthday in' provides a logical explanation for how he could celebrate his birthday in 'Italy' while only having his phone with him. It implies he was in a location named Italy, which directly resolves the question without any need for travel or visa materials.
SP-125_CR	3	0	3	The reason nobody stopped the thief is that he was not actively engaged in stealing at the moment he passed the policeman. While he may have a criminal background, being a thief does not mean he is committing a crime at all times. Therefore, since he wasn't in the act of stealing while running by, it explains why he was not stopped.
SP-126_CR	3	0	3	The scenario describes a situation where people are shooting each other and experiencing pain but no one dies. This is most logically explained by the fact that they were using fake guns like in paintball, where the projectiles cause pain but are not lethal. The other options suggest that injuries or medical assistance are involved, but they do not sufficiently explain why no one died despite being shot.
SP-127_CR	1	0	1	Robert is able to keep one silver sphere in the air while crossing the bridge, meaning he is not carrying the full weight of all the spheres at once. By juggling the spheres, he effectively reduces the total weight on the bridge to 81 kilograms (his weight) plus the weight of the one sphere in the air (2 kilograms), which is still under the 90-kilogram limit.
SP-128_CR	1	0	1	Jimy is the name of the fighter-jet, not a person. Therefore, it cannot receive medals or praises as a human would for bravery or accomplishments in war. This makes option 1 the best answer.
