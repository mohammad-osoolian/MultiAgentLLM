SP-0_SR	3	0	3	The teaser states that the six daughters each have one brother, implying that they all share the same single brother. Therefore, the family consists of the six daughters, their one brother, and their parents, totaling nine family members. Options 1 and 2 do not align with the clue given that the family only consists of nine people.
SP-1_SR	2	0	2	The scenario describes a woman who 'shoots' her spouse, which can imply taking a photograph rather than committing violence. She keeps him submerged in a developing solution, and then hangs the photograph to dry. This explains why they can go out together for dinner shortly afterâ€”it's a play on words involving photography.
SP-2_SR	3	0	3	Samuel's hair is not moist because he is bald, meaning he has no hair on his head to get wet. This explains why, despite being drenched from the rain, no hair can be moist.
SP-5_SR	2	0	2	This option explains that the fifth girl can receive her apple directly from the basket itself. Therefore, each of the five girls can receive one apple, while one of the apples remains in the basket, satisfying the condition of the riddle.
SP-6_SR	3	0	3	By sliding the newspaper under a door and having each sibling stand on either side, their mother effectively separated them while still having them 'on the same piece of newspaper.' This method prevents them from touching each other, fulfilling the mother's intention of punishment.
SP-7_SR	2	0	2	The horse can eat the hay because the rope is not tied to anything else. This means the horse can move freely and reach the hay, which is ten meters away, without any constraints from a fixed point.
SP-8_SR	3	0	3	The statement indicates that all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. If Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog, then the one remaining pet which is not a dog would be the cat, and the one remaining pet which is not a cat would be the dog. Thus, it's possible for Mrs. Smith to only have two pets in total: one cat and one dog.
SP-9_SR	3	0	3	The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States are Grover Cleveland, who served two non-consecutive terms. This means he is both the 22nd president (first term) and the 24th president (second term), thus sharing the same parents but not being considered separate individuals in terms of relation. This explanation makes the statement conceivable.
SP-10_SR	2	0	2	The most logical reason none of the females got wet is that it was not raining at all. If there was no rain, then the umbrella would not be needed, and thus, they wouldn't get wet regardless of whether they shared it or not.
SP-11_SR	3	0	3	The situation describes a scenario where street lights are out due to a power outage, and the dog is black, which would make it hard to see in the dark. However, if it was during daylight hours, the natural light would allow the driver to see the dog despite the circumstances. The broken headlights would not be a factor in visibility during the day, and the driver's hearing alone would not be reliable enough to ensure safety in this scenario.
SP-12_SR	3	0	3	The clue in the scenario is that the ship sank suddenly without any storm or mechanical issue. The most plausible explanation is that it was a submarine, which can submerge intentionally to dive underwater. This would make it appear as though it was sinking, but it is a normal operation for submarines. The other options do not provide a logical reason for the ship's sinking.
SP-13_SR	2	0	2	The man could only reach the button for the 15th floor because he was not tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. However, when it rained, he brought an umbrella with him, which he used to press the button for the 20th floor, allowing him to access it.
SP-15_SR	1	0	1	Natives of the Arctic cannot eat a penguin's egg because penguins only live in Antarctica, which is far from the Arctic. Therefore, they would never come across a penguin's egg regardless of their circumstances.
SP-17_SR	2	0	3	The husband recognized his wife among the rose bushes because it was the only one that leaned towards him as he approached. This implies a personal connection or recognition that transcended the physical transformation, suggesting that the essence of his wife still existed within the rose plant and responded to her husband, whereas the other identical rose bushes did not.
SP-18_SR	3	0	3	The scenario can be explained by the relationship dynamics: there is one grandfather who is also a father, one father who is also a son, and one son. This means that the three individuals can be represented as: grandfather (father), father (son), and son, totaling three individuals who can share three apples. This allows each one to have a single apple while fulfilling the roles of 2 fathers and 2 boys.
SP-20_SR	1	0	3	The riddle uses wordplay around the term 'killed 365 people.' The man is a calendar maker, and by excluding February 29th in a leap year, he effectively 'killed' that day for everyone, leading to 365 people missing out on that day. This explanation fits the clues in the riddle perfectly.
SP-21_SR	2	0	2	Sally was able to read without artificial lighting because she was blind and was using Braille, which does not require light to read. The other options suggest she either pretended to read or that it was daytime, but the scenario indicates the electricity went out, which could imply it was dark, so Braille is the most plausible explanation.
SP-22_SR	1	0	1	In a doubles match, two teams of two players compete. If each man won three sets in the five that were played, they could be partners on the same team, thus winning sets together rather than individually. Therefore, it is conceivable that both players have won three sets as part of a team effort.
SP-23_SR	3	0	3	The peasant counts 30 camels when he dismounts because he is not including his own camel in the count while he is riding it. When he is on the camel, he sees only the camels he has purchased and omits his own, leading him to initially count 29. When he dismounts, he sees all 30 camels, including the one he was riding, which explains the confusion in his counts.
SP-24_SR	3	0	2	John's statement about shooting and blowing up people can be interpreted in the context of video games, where such language is common and often associated with gameplay. Since the parents are happy with his professional decision as a video game designer, it suggests that they understand his intentions are related to the fantasy elements of video games rather than any real aggression. Additionally, their addiction to video games implies they support his interests, which further explains their positive reaction.
SP-25_SR	1	0	1	The brain teaser plays on the ambiguity of the scenario. If Brad jumped through the window, then he did so to enter the building, not to fall outside. Therefore, he could have slid through the window into a safe area inside, which means he did not fall at all, allowing him to be unharmed.
SP-26_SR	2	0	2	The brain teaser suggests a scenario where a 'tower' is jumped over by a 'horse,' which is a reference to the chess piece moves. In chess, the knight (often referred to as a horse) can jump over a piece referred to as a 'tower' (the rook). Therefore, this occurrence logically takes place on a chessboard where the game dynamics allow such actions.
SP-27_SR	2	0	2	The scenario describes Dorothy making plans to jump from a high location whenever she feels down, yet she claims to feel better afterwards and has never been hurt. This implies that her jumps are intentional and controlled, indicating that she is likely a skydiver or a BASE jumper, which aligns with option 2. Unlike a suicide attempt, her jumps are recreational and well-practiced, explaining why she remains unharmed and feels rejuvenated after each leap.
SP-28_SR	1	0	1	The statement refers to the fact that Mules are sterile and cannot reproduce. If all Mules died due to a mystery disease, they could not 'reappear' through natural reproduction. However, new Mules can be created again by crossing a female horse with a male donkey, leading to their presence again after some time. Thus, it is possible for them to 'reappear' after a year or so since they are a product of a hybridization process rather than traditional reproduction.
SP-29_SR	1	0	1	The riddle plays on the dual meaning of the word 'single.' The phrase 'not a single man gets wet' implies that none of the men were single, meaning they were all married, which is the clever twist in the riddle.
SP-31_SR	2	0	2	The scenario describes a horse moving in a circular path, such as in a mill. In such a pattern, the legs on the outside of the circle (the two outer legs) will cover a greater distance than those on the inside (the two inner legs), leading to the observed difference in distance traveled by the legs. This explains how one set of legs can cover a longer distance without any implication that there's a discrepancy in the horse's typical movement.
SP-32_SR	3	0	3	The man was unable to jump off the track immediately because he was on a bridge when he first saw the train. This would logically prevent him from jumping aside until he had moved to a safer position or had more space to maneuver, hence the need to move towards the train for a brief moment before jumping off.
SP-34_SR	3	0	3	The key to the riddle lies in the phrase 'the fifth did not' speed up. If the fifth man was dead and in a coffin, he wouldn't be affected by the rain, allowing him to arrive at the same location as the others without getting wet. The other four men, who were traveling actively in the rain, would get wet, but the deceased man would not.
SP-35_SR	2	0	2	The boat is only one meter from the shore, which means it is not very far to walk to safety. Since the boat is parked just one meter from the shoreline, they can simply step out of the boat and walk onto the shore without needing to wait for anything to happen like rising water levels or evaporation.
SP-36_SR	2	0	2	The doctor is the mother of the son. This riddle plays on the common stereotypes and assumptions that doctors are male, leading many to overlook that a female doctor can very well be the parent. Therefore, the statement 'I can't operate on him. He's my son.' indicates that the doctor is his mother.
SP-37_SR	2	0	2	The statement can be true if the 'beggar' is the man's sister. In this case, the beggar has a brother (the man), but the deceased (the brother of the beggar) would have no brothers, only a sister. This resolves the contradiction in the riddle.
SP-38_SR	1	0	1	The riddle describes activities associated with a dentist, such as creating crowns (dental crowns) and filling cavities (little caves) where gold and silver may metaphorically represent fillings. The mention of needing assistance and people being reluctant likely refers to the common fear or anxiety people have about dental visits. The other options don't fit the context of crafting dental work or the reluctance associated with visiting a dentist.
SP-39_SR	1	0	1	The riddle plays on the double meaning of the word 'Friday.' The cowboy arrives in town on a horse named 'Friday,' stays for two days, and leaves on a different horse named 'Wednesday.' This is a clever twist that allows for the seemingly impossible scenario to make sense.
SP-40_SR	2	0	2	Choosing the second door with the lions is the safest option because if they haven't eaten in five years, they would have died by now. Therefore, there would be no danger behind that door. The first door leads to certain death by fire, and the third door poses a significant risk with a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator, which could still be alive and harmful.
SP-41_SR	1	0	2	The phrase 'each single person is killed' refers specifically to individuals who were on the flight (single individuals, meaning those who were not married). The survivors, however, could include individuals who were not on the plane at all, therefore explaining how there were survivors despite the crash.
SP-43_SR	2	0	2	The woman ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, which means she placed the order in the previous year to be delivered at the start of the new year. This is a common practice for events or celebrations, making it possible for the pizza order to be delivered the following year.
SP-44_SR	2	0	2	At 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water would freeze into ice, making it difficult for the steel ball to fall through it, as the steel ball would not fall through solid ice. In contrast, at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the water is still in liquid form, allowing the steel ball to fall through it more quickly. Therefore, option 2 correctly explains the scenario.
SP-45_SR	3	0	3	Letting some air out of the tires would lower the height of the semi, providing enough space for it to pass under the overpass. This is a practical solution to the problem of being wedged under the bridge, unlike the other options which are not feasible or relevant in this context.
SP-46_SR	1	0	1	The key detail in the riddle is the reference to sunrise and the length of time it can take for a sunrise to occur in certain parts of the world. In Alaska, during certain times of the year, the sun does not rise for months, meaning that he could theoretically return home after a long period with a full-grown beard, as he may have been away for much longer than a typical night. This makes option 1 the most plausible explanation for his sudden appearance with a full-grown beard.
SP-48_SR	1	0	1	Christmas Day is chilly primarily because it falls in December, which is winter for many parts of the world. The lower temperatures during this month are attributed to the seasonal climate patterns rather than the activities or events occurring on that day.
SP-49_SR	3	0	3	The clue 'Wednesday' is misleading since it seems to refer to a day of the week. However, upon closer inspection, it indicates that 'Wednesday' is actually the name of the third person who was dining with Tom and Joe. If Tom and Joe didn't have to pay, then it logically follows that Wednesday, the third person, covered the bill.
SP-50_SR	3	0	3	The magician could drop the glass without spilling water because it wasn't actually filled with water; it was filled with something else, or it could be a trick where the glass appeared to be full but wasn't. Thus, no water spilled during the drop.
SP-51_SR	1	0	1	Craig and Tracy are referred to as hurricanes, which is a common occurrence where hurricanes are given names and their 'passing' refers to their dissipation as storms. People are often relieved or happy when a hurricane dissipates, as they can be destructive and dangerous. Therefore, the ecstatic reaction is due to the fact that the storms have dissipated, rather than a personal loss.
SP-52_SR	3	0	1	Morgan likely derived the correct amount of lemon juice needed due to her skills as a chef, which would include knowledge of ingredient ratios and cooking techniques. Being an excellent chef means she has a solid understanding of how to balance flavors, including how much lemon juice to use in relation to the number of apricots.
SP-53_SR	3	0	3	The woman can legally wed three men because she is a minister, which allows her to perform marriage ceremonies for others but does not necessarily mean she is married to them herself. This situation implies that she could be the officiant for these marriages rather than being a participant in them.
SP-54_SR	1	0	1	The most logical explanation is that George walked down the stairs because he was cleaning the inside of the windows, which meant he was not on the outside of the building. Therefore, when the power outage occurred, he could simply go down the stairs to escape without needing the hoist.
SP-55_SR	1	0	1	The woman initially has a $10 bill, which turns out to be counterfeit. She gives this to the man and receives the rope worth $3 in return. When she goes to change the counterfeit bill, she receives $7 in change and hands over a good bill to the cashier. In total, she loses her $7 in change (given to the man), plus the $3 value of the rope, making her total loss $10. However, since she loses the $10 bill when the cashier says it is counterfeit, she effectively loses $7 (the change she handed over) plus the $3 (the value of the rope) for a total loss of $10.
SP-56_SR	1	0	1	The two camels were facing each other the entire time, which means that one camel facing East and the other facing West can see one another without needing to turn, move their heads, or shift position. This scenario fits the description given in the riddle perfectly.
SP-57_SR	1	0	1	The most plausible explanation for the shooter being able to shoot at the hat despite wearing a blindfold is that he hung his hat on the barrel of his gun. This way, even with his vision obscured, he could aim his gun at the position of his hat simply by aiming the gun itself, as it would already be aligned with the hat when he fired.
SP-58_SR	1	0	1	The only plausible method that explains how the man could hang himself without a table or chair beneath him is that he stood on a block of ice until it melted. This would allow him to hang while initially standing on the ice, and once the ice melted, he would be left hanging without any means to stand on anything solid, which aligns with the scenario of finding him hanging with no furniture around.
SP-61_SR	3	0	3	The key detail in the riddle is that the truck driver was 'walking' and not driving the truck. Since pedestrians are allowed to walk down a one-way street in either direction, he wouldn't be breaking the law by walking three blocks down that street.
SP-62_SR	3	0	3	Nolan is unable to read the signs, which suggests that she might have vision problems. The best place for someone who is having difficulties reading due to eyesight issues would be an eye glasses store, where she can find solutions to improve her vision and make her purchase.
SP-64_SR	3	0	3	The nickname 'Batman' does not have to be related to the actual character or bats themselves. In this context, being the star baseball player could imply that he is seen as a hero or a standout player, similar to how Batman is viewed as a hero. Therefore, he may appreciate the nickname for its association with greatness in sports, despite not liking bats or knowing much about them.
SP-65_SR	3	0	3	The statement is possible because the secretary who spoke can be the girl's father, implying that the girl is their daughter. This means that the title 'mother' is not accurate for the secretary, allowing for the conclusion that the girl has a father who works as a secretary.
SP-66_SR	1	0	1	The poison being in the ice means that as the ice melts, it releases the poison into the drink. Maria, who takes longer to finish her drink, would ultimately consume the poison as the ice melts, leading to her demise. In contrast, Juliana consumes her drink much faster and may either finish it before the poison is released from the ice or possibly not get a significant amount of the poison before the ice has melted and fully mixed into the drink.
SP-67_SR	1	0	1	The scenario describes traveling south, then east, and finally north, returning to a point where you see a bear. This description aligns with the North Pole, where moving in such a direction would lead you back to the starting point. The only bears found at the North Pole are polar bears, which are white.
SP-68_SR	1	0	1	If the man is a barber, he likely shaves other people many times a day, but that doesn't affect his own beard's growth. This profession allows him to keep a long beard while still engaging in shaving activity without contradicting the premise.
SP-69_SR	2	0	2	The rancher took a panoramic photo of all his cows, and the phrase 'shot once' cleverly refers to taking a photograph rather than shooting a gun. Therefore, he didn't actually kill the cows but captured them in a single shot.
SP-70_SR	2	0	2	The man turning 25 and passing away from old age is possible if he was born on February 29th. Leap year babies celebrate their birthday only once every four years, so he would only have had 6 actual birthdays by the time he turns 25, making it plausible for him to be considered old for his age in an unusual way.
SP-71_SR	1	0	1	If Mrs. Adams' son was born on February 29, he would only have a birthday every four years. Therefore, on the day he turns 16, he would technically only have celebrated four actual birthdays. He would turn 20 on his next birthday in the year he turns 20, which would again be after four more years. This makes option 1 the only logical explanation for the situation.
SP-74_SR	3	0	3	The only logical explanation for the dog crossing the river without getting wet is that the river was frozen, allowing the dog to walk across the ice to reach the man on the opposite side.
SP-75_SR	2	0	2	The woman's concern stems from the fact that if the man truly believed it was his room, he would have attempted to open the door directly instead of knocking. This raises suspicion about his intentions and suggests that he might be lying or up to something deceptive, prompting her to make the security call.
SP-77_SR	1	0	1	Sally can wait for the colder months when the lake freezes over, providing a solid surface that she can walk across to transport her supplies to the island. This is a practical and feasible solution given her lack of traditional means of transportation.
SP-81_SR	3	0	2	The scenario describes a situation where the boy kicks the ball and it returns to him. The most logical explanation is that there is a rope tied between the boy and the ball, allowing it to come back after being kicked. The other options do not adequately explain how the ball could return after being kicked.
SP-82_SR	2	0	2	The situation can be explained by the presence of three generations: a grandmother, her daughter, and her granddaughter. This configuration means that there are two mothers (the grandmother and her daughter) and two daughters (the daughter and her daughter), allowing for a total of four individuals (two moms and two daughters) consuming just three slices of pizza.
SP-83_SR	3	0	3	The driver could see the guy because it was daytime, which means there was enough natural light for visibility, regardless of the fact that the guy was dressed in black and that the automobile had no lights on. This is the most logical explanation for how the driver knew he was there.
SP-84_SR	3	0	3	The value of 1968 pennies is higher than 1967 pennies simply because there is one additional penny in the 1968 total. Each penny is worth one cent, so having 1968 pennies means you have an additional cent compared to having 1967 pennies.
SP-88_SR	3	0	1	Last year refers to the year that is one year prior to the current year. Since New Year's Day (January 1) always occurs before Christmas (December 25) of the same year, the most recent instance when New Year's arrived before Christmas would indeed be last year, given it is always true for any year.
SP-89_SR	2	0	1	If the vice president passes away, the next in line for the presidency is the Speaker of the House as per the United States presidential line of succession. This means that in the absence of the vice president, the Speaker would be the one to take office.
SP-91_SR	2	0	2	The riddle plays with a word interpretation. The phrase 'which month has three?' refers to the word 'three' having five letters. So out of the provided options, 'They all do.' suggests that the question is about the total number of letters in the word 'three,' which is five, thus any of the months mentioned can fit this quirky phrasing.
SP-92_SR	1	0	1	Sandy saw the ocean on a map, which represents the ocean visually but does not contain actual water. This aligns with the statement of seeing an ocean devoid of water, as maps depict oceans without showing the physical presence of water.
SP-93_SR	3	0	3	The riddle states that not a single hair on the cat was wet, which implies that the cat does not have any hair to get wet. The most plausible explanation is that it is a hairless cat, which fits the condition given in the riddle.
SP-94_SR	1	0	1	The first option states that one person is already at the south side of the river, which directly explains how they both end up on the south side without needing to traverse the river with the boat. The other options suggest additional actions that are unnecessary given that one person is already there.
SP-95_SR	2	0	2	The girl traveled to the United States on the date of July 4 and returned on a boat named the 'July 4'. This allows for her to technically leave and return on the same date, making it possible to party for three days in between. The other options do not provide a logical explanation that aligns with the constraints of the riddle.
SP-96_SR	3	0	1	The first seven brothers are engaged in various activities, and since none of them is mentioned as doing the same activity (sleeping), it is logical to infer that Brother 8, as the only remaining brother, is likely to be sleeping. Additionally, an activity that contrasts with the active engagements of the other brothers supports this conclusion.
SP-97_SR	3	0	3	The most logical explanation is that the man lives in a lighthouse. If he neglected to turn on the light, it would result in a dangerous situation for passing ships, potentially causing a ship to crash. The self-blame upon reading the newspaper suggests that the consequences of forgetting to turn on the light were serious, which aligns with the function of a lighthouse, that is to prevent maritime accidents.
SP-98_SR	2	0	2	David's birthday is never in the winter because he lives in Australia, where December is a summer month. Therefore, his birthday falls in a season that is not winter, as the seasons are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere.
SP-99_SR	3	0	3	The scenario is conceivable because if the player scored a fourth goal but it was in their own goal (own goal), his teammates would reprimand him despite the hat trick. Scoring in one's own goal is a significant mistake in soccer, leading to a negative outcome for the team, hence the reason for the reprimand.
SP-100_SR	3	0	3	The riddle states that two girls were born at the same time on the same day and month, but they are not twins. This is possible if they were born in different years, for instance, one could be born just before midnight on December 31st and the other just after midnight on January 1st of the following year. Hence, despite sharing the same birthday, they are technically not twins because they were born in different years.
SP-101_SR	1	0	1	The man could see his own footstep clearly if he was walking backward. When someone walks backward, they can observe the prints they leave behind without needing to turn around, allowing for surprise at seeing their own footsteps.
SP-102_SR	2	0	2	Since the scenario states that it's pitch-black inside the cave but implies that there is daytime outside, the most logical solution is that they can just walk out of the cave into the daylight. This option suggests that the cave entrance is easily accessible, allowing them to escape without needing to navigate or confront their fears in the dark.
SP-103_SR	2	0	2	The statement refers to the sons being 'doctors' in an academic sense, which implies they hold doctoral degrees in other fields rather than being medical doctors. This explains how they can be referred to as doctors without attending medical school.
SP-104_SR	1	0	1	The phrase 'unwet' suggests that she didn't get wet, which indicates there was no water in the well. Therefore, if the well is dry, falling into it would not cause her to get wet, making option 1 the best answer.
SP-105_SR	1	0	1	The phrase 'I planted a stone' plays with the word 'stone,' which can refer to the seed of certain fruits, like cherries. In this case, the statement is possible because the item planted was not a typical rock, but the seed (or stone) of a fruit-bearing plant that can sprout leaves and fruit.
SP-107_SR	1	0	1	Roosters are male chickens and, therefore, cannot lay eggs. This makes the other options irrelevant since the premise of a rooster laying an egg is impossible.
SP-108_SR	3	0	3	The question states that the home is a single-story house, which means it does not have any stairs. Therefore, asking about the color of the stairs is irrelevant since there are no stairs present.
SP-109_SR	2	0	2	The situation describes two dads and two sons, which can be explained by the fact that one of the dads is also a son. Therefore, there is actually one grandfather (the first dad), his son (the second dad), and his son (the third person), making it possible for them to be counted as two dads and two sons while only being three people.
SP-110_SR	2	0	2	The bus driver did not violate any traffic laws because he was actually walking and not driving the bus at the time. Therefore, the actions described, such as going through a stop sign or turning left where prohibited, do not apply since those laws are relevant only when operating a vehicle.
SP-111_SR	2	0	2	The shopkeeper's statement 'Parrot repeats everything it hears' is technically true if the parrot is deaf, because it wouldn't hear anything to repeat. This means that the parrot is unable to repeat anything simply because it cannot hear sounds or words, thus allowing the shopkeeper to not be lying.
SP-112_SR	2	0	1	The phrase 'two legs' refers to the person leaving the room, and 'six legs' indicates the total number of legs when the person returns with another man. A man has two legs, so when you return with him, you have the original two legs plus the two from the man, giving a total of four. However, the option suggests bringing another man back, which can be interpreted to mean at least one additional person. Thus, if two people are counted, you'll have a total of four legs - This interpretation supports the humorous nature of the riddle.
SP-113_SR	1	0	1	The riddle plays on the fact that all people have at least one day in February that counts as '28 days old', since every person has a birthday, and February is the only month that traditionally has 28 days unless itâ€™s a leap year. So, essentially, every person has a 28, which means 'they all do.'
SP-114_SR	1	0	1	The scenario is conceivable because if the two students were born on the same day and month but in different years, they can still share the same birthday without being related. This makes it possible for them to go to the same school and share a teacher while having no familial connection.
SP-115_SR	1	0	1	The first option provides a logical explanation for the man's death. If he was an astronaut on a space walk, the ripping of his suit could mean exposure to the vacuum of space, which is extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The lack of pressure and oxygen would lead to death within minutes, justifying that he passed away three minutes later. The other options don't present plausible scenarios that could lead to immediate death.
SP-116_SR	1	0	1	Standing back to back allows both you and your friend to be positioned in such a way that you are physically behind each other. Each person faces opposite directions, fulfilling the condition of being behind one another.
SP-118_SR	3	0	3	The driver noticed the boy because it was during the daylight hours. If it were dark as stated, the other options wouldn't suffice, as the driver wouldn't be able to see well without light to notice the child. Thus, the key point is that the incident occurred during the daytime, allowing visibility even without headlights.
SP-119_SR	3	0	3	If all four automobiles made right-hand turns at the same time, they would all move in a different direction without colliding with each other. This would allow them to proceed without any accidents despite arriving simultaneously at the intersection.
SP-124_SR	2	0	3	The person mentioned in the riddle could be born on February 29th, which only occurs on leap years every four years. Therefore, if he was born in 1898, he would only have had his birthday celebrated 33 times by the time he reached the age of 33, which means he would only be celebrating his birthday every four years. This allows him to be 33 years old while still technically being born in a year (1898) that seems incompatible with his current age.
SP-125_SR	3	0	3	The key detail in the brain teaser is that the man is able to take a bend with only two wheels on the pavement. This indicates that he is likely riding a motorcycle, which only requires two wheels to be on the ground.
