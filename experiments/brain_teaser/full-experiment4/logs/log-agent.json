{"role": "user", "content": "Sally lives in a place where six months of the year is mild summer and the temperature drops significantly the other six months. She owns a lake where there is a small island. She wants to build a house on the island and needs to get materials there. She doesn't have a boat, plane, or anything to transport them to the island. How does Sally solve this problem?\n\n1. She waits to take the materials over during the colder months because the lake will freeze over, so she can walk over it.\n2.
