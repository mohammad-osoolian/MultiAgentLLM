SP-0	2	0	2	The statement indicates that Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and each of those daughters has one brother. Since all the daughters share the same brother, that accounts for one brother rather than multiple, resulting in a total of 8 family members (6 daughters + 1 brother + 2 parents = 9). This explains how the family consists of only 9 people while satisfying the conditions in the teaser.
SP-1	3	0	3	The riddle plays with the words 'shoots' and 'hangs'. The woman did not actually harm her husband; instead, she is a photographer who took a photo of him (shooting a picture), developed the photograph (holding it underwater), and then hung the picture up to dry. This explains how they could go out for dinner afterward.
SP-2	2	0	2	The explanation for why not a single hair on his head got wet is that Samuel is bald. If he does not have hair on his head, there would be no hair to get wet, regardless of the rain or his soaked clothes.
SP-5	3	0	1	By having two girls share one apple, you ensure that the remaining three girls each get their own apple, and the apple that is shared is still in the basket. This allows for one apple to remain in the basket while still ensuring each girl is accounted for.
SP-6	1	0	1	By sliding a newspaper under a door, each sibling can stand on either side of the door and thus not touch each other. This clever solution allows them to be punished by standing on the same newspaper while effectively maintaining the condition of not being able to touch.
SP-7	2	0	2	The horse can eat the hay because the rope is not tied to anything else. This means that even though the rope is five meters long, the horse can move freely in any direction and reach the hay that's ten meters away.
SP-8	3	0	3	Mrs. Smith can have one dog and one cat, which satisfies the conditions of the puzzle. All of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs except one (the cat), and all her pets are cats except one (the dog). This means each category holds true with just two pets, making option 3 the correct and most straightforward explanation.
SP-9	1	0	1	The statement refers to Grover Cleveland, who served as both the 22nd and 24th president. He is the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms, making it possible for him to be considered the same man holding two different presidential titles. Thus, the notion that they had the same parents but were not brothers is explained by the fact that they are the same individual.
SP-10	2	0	2	The primary reason all the girls did not get wet is that it was not raining. If there were no rain, the umbrella would not be needed at all, making it impossible for anyone to get wet. The other options revolve around the functionality of the umbrella, but the simplest and most logical explanation is the absence of rain.
SP-11	1	0	1	The key point in the riddle is that the situation occurs during a power failure caused by a storm with no working street lights. Therefore, if it was daytime, natural sunlight would provide enough visibility for the driver to see the black dog without relying on street lights or the headlights of the car. This option explains a plausible scenario where the driver could see the dog in time to avoid hitting it.
SP-12	1	0	1	The best explanation for the ship sinking without any apparent external conditions is that it was a submarine. Submarines are designed to submerge and can appear as ships when they are on the surface. Therefore, the sinking can be logically explained if the ship was a submarine that was simply diving.
SP-13	3	0	3	The most logical explanation is that the man wasn't tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. He could only reach the button for the 15th story. However, when it rained, he brought his umbrella, which he could use to press the higher button for the 20th floor, allowing him to ride all the way up.
SP-15	1	0	1	Penguins are native to Antarctica, not the Arctic. Therefore, it is impossible for Arctic natives to find or eat penguin eggs since penguins do not inhabit that region.
SP-17	2	0	3	The husband recognized his wife because the rose bush that was once her would naturally exhibit a behavior towards him, such as leaning towards him, showing an emotional connection. This physical reaction is the most plausible explanation among the options, as it reflects the bond between them.
SP-18	2	0	2	The correct interpretation is that there is one grandfather who is also a father, one father who is also a son, and one additional son. This gives us a total of three people: the grandfather (who is a father), the father (who is a son), and the son. Therefore, they can collectively eat the 3 apples, with each person getting their own apple.
SP-20	3	0	2	The scenario describes a man who 'killed' 365 people due to an act related to a calendar, specifically by accidentally excluding February 29th in a leap year. This act symbolically 'kills' that day for everyone who would have celebrated or had events on that date, making it a clever play on words rather than a literal act of violence.
SP-21	2	0	2	Sally could be reading in the dark if she was using Braille, as blind individuals can read tactile characters without the need for artificial light. The other options do not provide a plausible explanation for how she could continue reading when the power went out and there was no light available.
SP-22	1	0	1	In this scenario, if the two men were partners playing doubles, they would each play as part of a team against another team. In this case, it would be possible for each player to win three sets because they are not competing against each other directly but rather as part of a pair of teams.
SP-23	3	0	3	When the peasant is riding on one of the camels, he does not count that particular camel because he doesn't see it as he is sitting on it. Therefore, he counts only the 29 camels he can see from his vantage point. When he dismounts, he counts all the camels including the one he was riding, bringing the total to 30.
SP-24	1	0	1	The phrase 'shoot people and blow them up' can be interpreted as metaphorical language related to capturing images or creating action scenes in photography, rather than actual violence. Therefore, his parents could be proud because they understand that John wants to pursue a creative and non-violent career as a photographer.
SP-25	2	0	2	Brad opened the window and jumped inside, not outside, which means he did not actually fall from the 22nd floor but rather jumped into the building. Therefore, he remained uninjured.
SP-26	2	0	2	The scenario describes a situation where a horse could jump over a tower without it being an illusion or dream. This can occur in a game of chess where the 'horse' refers to the knight piece, which has the unique ability to jump over other pieces (representing the tower). Additionally, in chess, when a piece is captured (or jumps over another), it can be considered as disappearing from the board.
SP-27	3	0	3	Dorothy is likely a skydiver who jumps from high places with proper safety equipment, such as a parachute. Her jumps are controlled and planned, allowing her to safely experience the thrill of falling without the risk of injury. This explains why she feels better after jumping – the adrenaline and excitement of the jump could be a form of emotional release for her, helping her cope with feelings of sadness or depression.
SP-28	3	0	2	The butterfly fits the scenario because during the pupal stage, they undergo metamorphosis and are not visible, which can create the illusion that they have completely disappeared. After this stage, they emerge again, explaining how they can reappear after being 'wiped out'. The other options do not align with the concept of disappearance and reappearance in the same way as the butterfly's life cycle does.
SP-29	2	0	2	The riddle plays on the phrase 'not a single man,' which implies that all men were married. Therefore, even though they sank, the statement works linguistically rather than literally, and it cleverly avoids the assumption that they would get wet merely due to being in the water.
SP-31	1	0	1	The scenario describes a horse walking in a circular path, like when it operates a mill. In this case, the legs on the outside of the circle (the outer legs) will cover a greater distance than the legs on the inside (the inner legs). This explains why two of the horse's legs travel almost 31 miles while the other two travel only 30 miles each day. Thus, it illustrates that the horse is indeed normal and the difference in distance traveled by the legs is due to the nature of circular motion.
SP-32	2	0	2	The man likely couldn't jump off the track immediately because he was on a bridge, which would prevent him from doing so safely. By moving towards the train for a brief moment, he may be assessing his situation and looking for a safer way to escape the danger, as jumping off a bridge can be more hazardous than running a short distance away.
SP-34	2	0	2	The 5th man was dead and in a coffin. This explains why he did not get wet like the others, as he was not physically exposed to the rain. The other four men, despite speeding up, would still be wet from the rain, while the 5th man remained dry in the coffin.
SP-35	2	0	2	Since the boat is only one meter from the shoreline, they can simply get out of the boat and walk to the shore without any fear or waiting for the water level to rise or evaporate. The distance is manageable, making option 2 the most straightforward and logical solution.
SP-36	3	0	3	The doctor is the mother of the son. This brain teaser plays on societal assumptions and biases about gender roles, particularly the expectation that a doctor is male. In reality, the doctor can be female and is the boy's mother, which explains why she says she can't operate on her son.
SP-37	3	0	3	The riddle states that 'the beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother.' The most straightforward explanation is that the beggar is actually the man's sister. Therefore, the beggar has a brother (the one who died), but since the deceased is a male and had no brothers, this resolves the riddle correctly.
SP-38	2	0	2	The riddle describes a profession that involves digging out cavities (tiny caves) and handling precious metals such as gold and silver, which can metaphorically represent dental fillings (gold and silver) used in dentistry. Additionally, dentists create crowns for teeth, hence the reference to building crowns of gold. The fear that people have about dentists aligns with the idea that many are afraid to let them help due to anxiety about dental procedures.
SP-39	2	0	2	The explanation is that the cowboy rides into town on a horse named Wednesday. Therefore, he can ride into town on a horse called Friday, stay for two days, and leave on the horse named Wednesday. The phrasing creates a playful twist on time by using the horse's name instead of implying days of the week.
SP-40	3	0	3	Choosing the second door is the best option because if the lions haven't eaten in 5 years, they would be dead. Therefore, there would be no threat from that door, making it the most likely option for survival.
SP-41	2	0	1	The phrase 'every single person on board this flight was killed' implies that all individuals who were on the plane and were not married ('single') died. However, it does not specify that there weren't people on the ground or in another location who survived. Thus, there could be survivors, as they could refer to people who were not on the plane at all.
SP-43	2	0	2	The lady ordered the pizza specifically for New Year's Day, which is in the next year, making it possible for her order to arrive in the next year by design rather than delay.
SP-44	2	0	2	At 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water freezes and becomes ice, which would not allow the steel ball to fall through it. Therefore, the steel ball falls more rapidly through liquid water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than at 20 degrees Fahrenheit where the water is frozen.
SP-45	3	0	3	The fellow trucker likely suggested that Danny let some air out of his tires to lower the height of the semi. By reducing the air pressure in the tires, the overall height of the truck would decrease, allowing it to free itself from the tight space under the overpass.
SP-46	3	0	3	The scenario describes a situation where the boy appears to have grown a full-grown beard overnight after being told to be home by sunrise. The most plausible explanation given the context is option 3, which suggests he lives in Alaska where the sun does not rise for extended periods. Therefore, he could have been home before the next sunrise, which could occur months later, allowing plenty of time for his beard to grow.
SP-48	1	0	1	Christmas occurs in December, which is typically winter in many parts of the world. This geographical and seasonal context is the primary reason why it is cold during this time, as opposed to the other options which do not directly relate to the weather.
SP-49	1	0	1	The name 'Wednesday' is mentioned as the third person who went to the restaurant with Tom and Joe. Since it states that Tom and Joe didn't pay, it follows logically that Wednesday must have been the one who paid for the dinner.
SP-50	1	0	1	The magician could have had a glass filled to the top, but instead of water, it could be filled with a different liquid or substance that does not spill as easily, such as a viscous fluid. This would allow him to drop the glass without spilling any liquid, making option 1 the most plausible explanation.
SP-51	1	0	1	Craig and Tracy refer to hurricanes, which are natural disasters that can cause significant damage and loss of life. When hurricanes dissipate or 'die,' people often feel relief and delight because it means they are no longer a threat to safety and property. Thus, the lack of mourning is due to the fact that these were not individuals but rather storms that have passed, making the first option the best answer.
SP-52	3	0	1	Morgan being an excellent chef implies that she has the skills and knowledge to know how to measure ingredients accurately and understand how to follow a recipe. This skill would help her determine how much lemon juice to add based on the number of apricots, so this option makes the most sense.
SP-53	3	0	3	The woman is a minister, which means she can legally marry people without being married herself. Therefore, she can be married to three men simultaneously without the need for divorce or separation, as her role allows her to perform marriage ceremonies.
SP-54	3	0	3	George was cleaning the windows on the inside of the office block, which means he had access to the stairwell to exit. Since the hoist was immobilized due to a power failure, the most logical solution for him to get down safely would be to walk down the stairs rather than trying to find another escape route or dealing with a heavy object.
SP-55	2	0	2	The woman loses the $7.00 she gave back to the man plus the rope worth $3.00, which totals $10.00. However, since the man initially bought the rope for $3.00, we add that cost to her overall loss, totaling $10.00. The counterfeit bill also means she does not actually gain anything from the transaction. Thus, her total loss is $7.00 plus the rope, resulting in option 2 being the best answer.
SP-56	3	0	3	The camels can see each other if they were positioned at a point where the definitions of ' facing due East' and 'facing due West' can overlap, implying they are looking directly at each other from certain angles despite their stated directions. However, since they were described as facing opposite directions, the only logical solution is that there was a misunderstanding in how they were placed or positioned, which the option suggests. The phrase 'facing each other' implies direct visibility without needing to move or turn.
SP-57	2	0	2	The sharpshooter managed to shoot through his hat because he hung it directly on the barrel of his gun. This means that even though he was blindfolded and couldn't see, when he turned around to shoot, he was aiming right at his hat, which was positioned on the gun. Therefore, the setup allowed him to shoot through the hat without needing to rely on sight or sound.
SP-58	2	0	2	The clue about the puddle of water suggests that the man stood on a block of ice. Once he hung himself, the ice melted, leaving only the water on the floor. This explains the absence of any furniture and how he could have hanged himself without any visible means to do so.
SP-61	3	0	3	The truck driver was walking means he wasn't actually driving the truck, so he was not breaking any laws related to vehicle traffic on a one-way street. Pedestrians can walk in either direction on a street, regardless of traffic rules for vehicles.
SP-62	1	0	1	Nolan cannot read the signs, which suggests that her inability to read may be related to vision problems. An eye glasses store would be the most logical choice since she would need to go in to purchase glasses that would help her see better.
SP-64	2	0	2	The name 'Batman' could be a nickname that reflects his prowess in baseball, perhaps because he hits home runs or makes impressive plays reminiscent of superhero actions. While he may not like bats themselves, the connection to being a star player adds a layer of pride to the name, making him enjoy being called 'Batman' despite his feelings about actual bats.
SP-65	3	0	3	The statement makes sense if the secretary is the girl's father. In this case, the little girl can be referred to as the secretary's daughter, fulfilling the statement. The woman is the mother, and the secretary being male (her father) clarifies the situation.
SP-66	3	0	2	The poison likely needed time to dissolve, which means that although both Juliana and Maria drank the poisoned drink, the time it took for the poison to be effective allowed Juliana to finish her drinks before the poison could take effect in Maria. This explains why Maria died while Juliana did not, as the concentration of poison in Maria's body reached a lethal level before she could finish her drink.
SP-67	2	0	2	This riddle describes a journey that ends up in a very specific location: the North Pole. The only bears that inhabit the area around the North Pole are polar bears, which are white. Therefore, since the bear was encountered at the North Pole, it must be white.
SP-68	1	0	1	The man can be a barber who shaves other people as part of his job while maintaining his own long beard. This is a common scenario where his profession allows him to shave often without affecting his own beard growth.
SP-69	3	0	3	The phrase 'took one shot that got them all' is a play on words. The rancher likely took a panoramic photo of all 500 cows, capturing them in one image. The other options suggest shooting animals, which does not align with the context of the puzzle.
SP-70	1	0	1	The man was born on February 29th, which only occurs every four years. Therefore, he would celebrate his birthday only once every four years, making his 25th birthday the actual age of 100 years old in regular calendar years. This is how he can die of old age on his 25th birthday.
SP-71	1	0	1	If Mrs. Adams' son was born on February 29, he only gets to celebrate his birthday every four years. Therefore, although he turns 16 today, the next time he celebrates a birthday, he will technically be 20 in terms of the calendar years (counting the years he has actually existed vs. the number of birthdays celebrated). This makes the first option the only logical explanation that fits the scenario.
SP-74	1	0	1	The most logical explanation is that the river was frozen, allowing the dog to walk across the ice without getting wet. The other options involve unrealistic scenarios that do not fit the conditions of the brain teaser.
SP-75	3	0	3	The woman's suspicion arises from the fact that if the man genuinely believed it was his hotel room, he would have attempted to enter the room without knocking first. The act of knocking suggests he knew he was not supposed to be there, which raises her concern about his intentions.
SP-77	1	0	1	Since Sally lives in a place where the lake freezes over during the colder months, she can walk over the ice to transport the materials to the island. This solution is practical and uses the natural freezing of the lake to her advantage, providing a straightforward way to solve her problem without needing any vehicles or additional resources.
SP-81	3	0	2	The most plausible explanation for the boy kicking the soccer ball ten feet and then having it come back to him is that there is a rope between the ball and the boy. This would allow the boy to kick the ball while still being connected to it, causing the ball to return after being kicked. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for the ball coming back on its own.
SP-82	3	0	3	The scenario can be explained by the fact that there are three people involved: a grandmother, her daughter (who is also a mother), and her daughter's daughter (who is a daughter). This means there are two mothers (the grandmother and her daughter) and two daughters (the daughter and her daughter), but only three individuals in total, which accounts for the three slices of pizza eaten.
SP-83	1	0	1	The presence of daylight would allow the driver to see the man dressed in all black despite his dark clothing, which explains how the driver was able to spot him before any potential incident occurred.
SP-84	3	0	3	The 1968 pennies are worth more than 1967 pennies because there is one more penny in the 1968 collection (1968 pennies) than in the 1967 collection (1967 pennies). This plays on the idea that a larger quantity inherently has greater value, making option 3 the most logical answer.
SP-88	1	0	1	New Year's Day is celebrated on January 1st, while Christmas is on December 25th. Thus, every year, New Year's occurs before Christmas. Therefore, the most recent year in which this is true is 'this year'.
SP-89	1	0	2	If the vice president were to die, the next in line to assume the presidency is the Speaker of the House, according to the presidential succession order established by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Therefore, option 2 is the correct answer.
SP-91	1	0	1	The riddle plays on the word 'three' itself, which has five letters, and therefore 'They all do' serves as a clever wordplay suggesting that all months actually have names with letters counting to three when you take the riddle's context into account. Additionally, the correct interpretation is that months themselves do not literally have names with three letters, but the phrasing implies a trick answer.
SP-92	3	0	3	Sandy could be referring to an 'ocean' that is represented on a map. Maps show geographical features like oceans but do not contain actual water. This explanation aligns with the idea of seeing an ocean without water, making it the most logical answer.
SP-93	2	0	2	The phrase 'not a single hair was wet' implies that the cat does not have any hair to get wet. This suggests that the cat in question is a hairless cat, which is a known breed. Therefore, option 2 is the correct explanation.
SP-94	3	0	3	Since one person was already at the south side of the river, it explains how they both ended up on that side without having to cross the river together. The first man did not need to use the boat at all, as he was already on the desired side.
SP-95	3	0	3	The girl traveled to the U.S. on a boat named 'July 4' and returned on the same boat, which allowed her to leave on the 4th of July and come back on the same date after partying for 3 days.
SP-96	3	0	1	The riddle implies a pattern of activities that the brothers are engaged in, and it suggests that Brothers 1 through 7 are preoccupied with different tasks. Since Brother 7 is already sleeping, it’s implied that Brother 8 can also be sleeping, as there is no conflict with this option. The other options introduce activities that are already accounted for by the previous brothers.
SP-97	3	0	3	The man lived in a lighthouse, and turning on the light is crucial for navigation. If he forgot to turn on the light, it would have resulted in a ship crashing, leading to deep self-blame for the consequences of his oversight. This scenario highlights the importance of the lighthouse's light for safety at sea.
SP-98	3	0	3	David's birthday is in December, which corresponds to summer in Australia, as the seasons are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, he can celebrate his birthday in December without it being winter.
SP-99	2	0	2	The scenario suggests that the player from Team One scored a hat trick, which means he scored three goals for his own team. However, when he scored the fourth goal, it led to his teammates scolding him because he scored in their own goal instead of the opposing team's goal. This would understandably upset his teammates, as scoring an own goal is detrimental to the team's performance.
SP-100	2	0	2	The two girls can be siblings who were born on the same day but in different years. This means they share the same birthday but are not considered twins. The condition of being twins requires them to have been born within the same year, so being born at the same time on the same day but in different years allows them to not be categorized as twins.
SP-101	1	0	3	The reflection by the sea can allow the man to see his footsteps without physically turning back. The water's surface can act like a mirror, providing a reflective view of what is behind him, including his footprints.
SP-102	1	0	1	The best option is that they can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave. This implies that they are not truly trapped in darkness, and since it's daytime, they have visibility outside the cave which allows them to find their way out without being in fear of darkness, bats, or getting lost in complete darkness.
SP-103	2	0	2	The term 'doctor' can refer to someone who has earned a doctorate degree in any field, not just medicine. Therefore, the woman's sons could be 'doctors' in fields like philosophy, education, or any other area, without having attended medical school.
SP-104	1	0	1	The answer is that the well is dry. If the well has no water in it, then even if the girl slipped and fell into it, she wouldn't get wet.
SP-105	3	0	3	The riddle plays on the word 'stone,' which can refer to the hard pit of a fruit such as a cherry. In this context, the 'stone' is actually a seed, and when buried in the ground, it can sprout and grow into a cherry tree that produces fruit. The other options do not provide an explanation that aligns with this transformation.
SP-107	2	0	2	Roosters are male chickens and do not lay eggs. Therefore, the premise of the rooster laying an egg is incorrect, making option 2 the best answer.
SP-108	1	0	1	A single-story house by definition has only one level, meaning it does not have any stairs. Therefore, the correct answer is that there are no stairs in a single-story house.
SP-109	2	0	2	The scenario involves three individuals: a grandfather (who is also a father), his son (who is also a father), and the grandson (who is a son). Thus, there are two fathers and two sons, but only three people in total. This explains how they could each have one of the three fish caught, even when the phrasing suggests more individuals than there really are.
SP-110	1	0	1	The bus driver was not driving; he was walking. Therefore, he did not break any traffic laws, as those laws apply to vehicles and not to pedestrians.
SP-111	3	0	3	The shopkeeper's sign said the parrot repeats everything it hears. If the parrot was deaf, it wouldn't be able to hear anything, and therefore it couldn't repeat anything. This statement aligns with the shopkeeper not lying about the parrot's abilities, as the parrot is incapable of repeating due to its inability to hear.
SP-112	3	0	1	If you leave the room with two legs, and then bring another man back with you, you would be returning with a total of six legs—yours plus the other man's four legs.
SP-113	2	0	2	All months have at least 28 days. While only February typically has 28 days in a non-leap year, every month has 28 days included within it. Therefore, the correct answer is that they all do.
SP-114	2	0	2	The key to the riddle is that while the students share the same birthday in terms of day and month, they can still be born in different years. This would explain how they are not siblings, despite having the same teacher and attending the same school.
SP-115	2	0	2	The most logical explanation is that the man was an astronaut on a space walk. In the vacuum of space, if a suit is torn, it can lead to rapid decompression or exposure to the vacuum, resulting in death within minutes due to lack of oxygen and other fatal conditions. This aligns with the context of the situation where a suit's integrity is critical for survival in space.
SP-116	3	0	3	The only way for two people to be positioned such that each one is standing behind the other is to stand back to back. In this configuration, each person is physically behind the other, fulfilling the condition of the brain teaser.
SP-118	1	0	1	The scenario does not mention that it is nighttime; it only states that the electricity was out and the moon wasn't out, which implies it could be during the daytime. If it was daytime, the driver could see the boy clearly regardless of his clothing.
SP-119	2	0	2	The situation describes four cars arriving at a four-way stop but not crashing into each other. If all four vehicles make right-hand turns, they will all be able to proceed without colliding because their paths will diverge after the turn, allowing them to move forward simultaneously.
SP-124	1	0	3	The man being 33 years old while being born in 1898 is possible if his birthday is on February 29th. This date only occurs every four years in leap years, which means he would have only celebrated his birthday 8 times by the age of 33 (leap years from 1900 to 1932). Thus, he could still be 33 years old despite being born in 1898.
SP-125	1	0	1	If the man was on a motorcycle, it is common for motorcycles to lean into turns, causing only two wheels (those of the motorcycle) to be on the pavement when making a sharp turn. In that case, the policeman would not give him a ticket because it's normal behavior for motorcycle riders.
SP-126	2	0	2	The riddle describes a game being played through the night where all participants end up gaining without anyone losing. The key lies in the term 'musicians' as it suggests they were playing music together (not just a game of cards) and potentially sharing their earnings from a performance or similar endeavor, allowing all to benefit. This resolves the paradox where no one lost, yet everyone gained.
SP-127	3	0	3	Johnny was able to cross the bridge while holding the three pieces of gold because he used his juggling skills to keep one piece in the air at all times. This way, only two pieces of gold were on the bridge with him at any given time, which only added 2 kg to his weight, keeping him under the 80 kg limit.
