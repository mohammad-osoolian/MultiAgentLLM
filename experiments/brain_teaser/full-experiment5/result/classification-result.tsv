SP-0	2	0	2	The statement indicates that Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. Since all the daughters share the same brother, this means there is only one brother in total. Therefore, the family consists of Mr. Mustard, Mrs. Mustard, their six daughters, and one son, totaling nine people.
SP-1	3	0	3	The key to the riddle lies in the word 'shot.' The woman did not actually shoot her husband with a gun; instead, she took a photograph of him. Holding the photo underwater refers to the developing process of the photograph, and hanging it up to dry is a common step in photography. Therefore, they both enjoyed dinner together afterward because the husband was never in any real danger.
SP-2	2	0	2	The statement indicates that not a single hair on his head got wet, which implies that he has no hair. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that Samuel is bald.
SP-5	3	0	1	By having two girls share one apple, each of the five girls still receives an apple, while one apple remains in the basket for the fifth girl. This satisfies the condition of each girl getting an apple and leaving one in the basket.
SP-6	1	0	1	By sliding a newspaper under a door, Tom and his sister can stand on either side of the door, ensuring they are on the same piece of newspaper while being unable to touch each other. This solution effectively meets the mother's requirement of punishing them without allowing physical contact.
SP-7	2	0	2	The horse can eat the hay because the rope is not tied to anything else. This means the horse can move freely and reach the hay without any restrictions from the rope.
SP-8	3	0	3	Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog. This satisfies the condition that all her pets are dogs except one (the cat) and all her pets are cats except one (the dog). Therefore, the statement is true with just two pets: one dog and one cat.
SP-9	1	0	1	The 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States were Grover Cleveland, who served two non-consecutive terms. This means he was both the 22nd and 24th president, making it possible for him to have the same parents and not be brothers.
SP-10	2	0	2	The most straightforward explanation is that it was not raining, which means all the girls would not get wet regardless of the umbrella situation. The other options suggest scenarios that could explain why they didn't get wet, but the simplest and most direct answer is that there was no rain at all.
SP-11	1	0	1	The scenario describes a situation where the street lights are not working and it is dark due to a power failure. The only way the driver could have seen the black dog in the middle of the intersection is if it was during the daylight hours, as this would provide natural light to see the dog clearly. The other options do not adequately explain how the driver could have seen the dog in the dark.
SP-12	1	0	1	The ship sank because it was a submarine. Submarines are designed to submerge underwater, and they can appear to 'sink' even in calm conditions. The other options do not provide a plausible reason for a ship to sink suddenly without any apparent issues.
SP-13	3	0	3	The man could only reach the button for the 15th floor because he was not tall enough to reach the button for the 20th floor. However, when it rained, he used his umbrella to press the button for the 20th floor, allowing him to ride all the way up. This explains why he could only go to the 15th floor on normal days but could reach the 20th floor when it rained.
SP-15	1	0	1	Penguins are native to the Southern Hemisphere, primarily found in Antarctica, while the Arctic is in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, natives living in the Arctic would not have access to penguin eggs, making option 1 the best answer.
SP-17	2	0	3	The husband recognized his wife by the way the rose bush leaned towards him as he approached. This suggests a connection or recognition that goes beyond physical appearance, indicating that the bush representing his wife had a unique response to him, reflecting their bond.
SP-18	2	0	2	The scenario can be explained by the fact that the two sons are actually one son and one father, and the two fathers include the grandfather. Therefore, there are three individuals: the grandfather (who is a father), the father (who is also a son), and the son. This accounts for the three apples being distributed among them, with each person receiving one apple.
SP-20	3	0	2	The man is a calendar maker who accidentally excluded February 29th on a leap year's calendar. This means that he 'killed' the day for 365 people, as they would not have a birthday or a day to celebrate that year. The phrasing of 'killed 365 people' is a metaphorical way of saying he omitted a day that affects 365 individuals, making this option the most logical explanation.
SP-21	2	0	2	Sally was able to read without artificial light because she was reading a book by Braille, which does not require visual light to read. This explains how she could continue reading even after the power went out.
SP-22	1	0	1	The two men could have been partners playing doubles, meaning they were part of a team rather than competing against each other. In this scenario, each team could win sets, leading to both men having three wins collectively.
SP-23	3	0	3	When the peasant is riding his camel, he does not count the camel he is riding, which is why he counts only 29. When he dismounts and counts the camels on the ground, he includes all of them, resulting in a count of 30. This explains the discrepancy in his counts.
SP-24	1	0	1	John's statement about wanting to 'shoot people and blow them up' can be interpreted in a non-violent context if he is referring to photography, where 'shooting' means taking pictures. This aligns with the parents being proud of his career choice, as photography is a creative and non-violent profession.
SP-25	2	0	2	The key to the riddle is that Brad jumped through the window but ended up inside the building rather than outside. Therefore, he did not actually fall to the ground but instead jumped into the office space, which explains why he was completely uninjured.
SP-26	2	0	2	The scenario described is a metaphorical one that can occur on a chessboard. In chess, a horse refers to the knight piece, which can 'jump' over other pieces (including towers, which represent rooks) during the game. The disappearance of the tower (rook) can symbolize it being captured or removed from the board, making this the only logical and fitting answer.
SP-27	3	0	3	Dorothy is likely a sky jumper, which means she is engaging in a sport that involves jumping from high places with a parachute. This explains why she has never been injured or died from her jumps, as skydiving is a controlled activity with safety measures in place. Her feelings of sadness may lead her to seek the thrill and adrenaline rush of jumping, which can provide a temporary sense of relief and euphoria, making her feel better afterward.
SP-28	3	0	2	The butterfly undergoes a life cycle that includes a pupal stage (cocoon or chrysalis) where it may seem to have disappeared. This aligns with the scenario where the animal appears to be wiped out but later reappears, as they are not truly gone but in a different life stage.
SP-29	2	0	2	The riddle plays on the word 'single.' The phrase 'not a single man got wet' implies that none of the men were unmarried, as they were all married. This is a clever twist in the wording rather than a literal interpretation of the situation.
SP-31	1	0	1	The horse operates a mill and travels in a circular clockwise direction. In this scenario, the two outside legs of the horse travel a longer distance than the two inside legs due to the circular path. This explains why two legs travel 30 miles while the other two travel nearly 31 miles, as the outside legs cover more ground in the same amount of time.
SP-32	2	0	2	The most logical explanation for the man's behavior is that he was on a bridge when he first saw the train, which would prevent him from jumping off the track immediately. This scenario explains why he would charge towards the train instead of jumping off, as he may have had no other option due to the constraints of his environment.
SP-34	2	0	2	The 5th man was dead and in a coffin, which explains why he did not get wet despite the rain. The other four men, who were alive, would have gotten wet as they traveled in the rain, but the 5th man, being in a coffin, remained dry.
SP-35	2	0	2	The boat is only one meter from the shoreline, which means they can simply step out of the boat and walk onto the shore without any risk. The other options involve waiting for conditions to change, which is unnecessary since they are already so close to safety.
SP-36	3	0	3	The doctor is the mother of the son. This brain teaser highlights the common stereotype that doctors are male, which can lead to confusion in understanding the scenario. The mother can be a doctor and is therefore the one who cannot operate on her son due to the emotional conflict of being his parent.
SP-37	3	0	3	The riddle states that the beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. This can be explained if the beggar is actually the man's sister. In this case, the beggar has a brother (the man), but the man who died has no brother because he is the only male sibling. Therefore, option 3 is the correct answer.
SP-38	2	0	2	The riddle describes someone who digs out tiny caves (which can refer to cavities in teeth) and stores gold and silver (which can refer to dental fillings). The mention of building bridges of silver refers to dental bridges, and crowns of gold refers to gold crowns used in dentistry. Many people need dental help but are often afraid of visiting the dentist due to fear of pain or anxiety associated with dental procedures.
SP-39	2	0	2	The cowboy can ride into town on a horse named Wednesday, which allows him to ride out on Wednesday after staying for two days. The phrasing of the riddle plays on the dual meaning of 'Friday' as both a day of the week and the name of his horse.
SP-40	3	0	3	The second door with the lions is the best option because if the lions haven't eaten in 5 years, they would be dead. Therefore, there would be no danger from the lions, allowing for a likely survival. The first door is destroyed and contains fire, and the third door has a 1,000-foot drop which is fatal regardless of the alligator's state.
SP-41	2	0	1	The statement specifies that 'every single person on board this flight was killed,' which implies that all individuals who were on the plane and were not in a relationship (i.e., single) died. However, it does not account for people who were not on the plane at all. Therefore, the survivors could be individuals who were not on the flight, making this option the most logical explanation.
SP-43	2	0	2	The lady ordered the pizza for New Year's Day, which means she intended for it to be delivered on that specific date in the following year. This explains why the delivery occurred the next year without any issues related to delays or lost couriers.
SP-44	2	0	2	At 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water freezes and becomes ice, which would not allow the steel ball to fall through it. Therefore, the steel ball would fall more rapidly through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, where the water is still in liquid form, compared to the ice at 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
SP-45	3	0	3	The fellow trucker suggested that Danny let some air out of his tires. By reducing the air pressure in the tires, the height of the semi would decrease slightly, potentially allowing it to clear the overpass and free itself from being wedged. This is a practical solution to the problem of being stuck under a low overpass.
SP-46	3	0	3	The scenario suggests that the boy was home by the next sunrise, but he had a full-grown beard. This implies a significant passage of time. The most plausible explanation is that he lives in Alaska, where during certain times of the year, the sun does not rise for extended periods (up to six months), allowing for a full beard to grow without the sun rising again. The other options do not adequately explain the time lapse required for a full-grown beard.
SP-48	1	0	1	The primary reason it is cold on Christmas is that it falls in December, which is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. This seasonal change brings colder temperatures, making option 1 the most logical answer.
SP-49	1	0	1	The statement indicates that Tom and Joe didn't pay, which implies that the only other person present, Wednesday, must have been the one who paid for the dinner. The name 'Wednesday' refers to the third person in the group, not the day of the week.
SP-50	1	0	1	The magician could have filled the glass with a substance other than water, such as a gel or a solid that resembles water, which would allow him to drop it without spilling anything. This option provides a plausible explanation for how the glass could be dropped without spilling, as it does not rely on the properties of water itself.
SP-51	1	0	1	Craig and Tracy are names given to hurricanes, which are often named by meteorological organizations. When hurricanes die down or dissipate, it is a cause for celebration as it means that the threat to life and property has ended. Therefore, the delight expressed by people is due to the end of the hurricanes rather than the loss of human life.
SP-52	3	0	1	Morgan's ability to determine the amount of lemon juice needed based on the number of apricots suggests she has a good understanding of cooking measurements and ratios, which is a skill of an excellent chef. The other options do not directly relate to the task of measuring ingredients in cooking.
SP-53	3	0	3	The woman is a minister, which means she may have the authority to perform marriages. Therefore, she can legally marry multiple people without being in a traditional marital relationship with them herself. This explains how she can be legally married to three men without having divorced or separated from any of them.
SP-54	3	0	3	George was cleaning the inside of the windows, which means he had access to the interior of the building. In the event of a power failure that immobilized the electric hoist, the most logical and feasible way for him to get down would be to walk down the stairs, as he would not be trapped outside the building.
SP-55	2	0	2	The woman initially loses the rope, which is worth $3.00, and she also loses the $7.00 she gave back to the man. Therefore, her total loss is $7.00 (cash) + $3.00 (the rope) = $10.00. However, since she had to give the clerk a good bill after realizing the $10 bill was counterfeit, she effectively loses an additional $3.00 (the value of the rope) on top of the $7.00 she returned to the man. Thus, her total loss is $7.00 plus the rope, which is the best answer.
SP-56	3	0	3	The statement that 'the two camels were facing each other the entire time' is the only option that logically allows them to see each other without needing to move or turn. If one camel is facing East and the other is facing West, they cannot see each other unless they are positioned in such a way that they are actually facing each other, which is not possible if they are truly facing opposite directions. Therefore, this option is the best answer.
SP-57	2	0	2	The sharpshooter hung his hat on the barrel of his gun, which means that when he turned around and shot, the bullet would go through the hat that was still attached to the gun. This explains how he could shoot through his hat while being blindfolded, as the hat was not placed on a separate location but rather directly on the gun itself.
SP-58	2	0	2	The scenario describes a dead man who hung himself from the ceiling with a puddle of water beneath him. The most logical explanation is that he stood on a block of ice to hang himself, and once the ice melted, it left only the puddle of water behind, making it appear as if he had no means to hang himself.
SP-61	3	0	3	The truck driver was walking, which means he was not driving the truck and therefore not violating any traffic laws by going the wrong way down a one-way street.
SP-62	1	0	1	Nolan is unable to read the signs, which suggests that she may have a vision impairment. An eye glasses store would be the most relevant place for her to go in order to make a purchase that could help her with her inability to read. The other options, while they could be stores she might visit, do not directly address her need for assistance with reading.
SP-64	2	0	2	The name 'Batman' could be a nickname given to him due to his prowess in baseball, perhaps because he hits home runs or makes impressive plays, similar to how a superhero would. This would explain why he enjoys being called Batman despite not knowing anything about bats, as it relates to his identity as a star player rather than the animal itself.
SP-65	3	0	3	The statement can be explained if the secretary is the girl's father. In this case, the woman is the mother, and the secretary, who is a male, is the father of the little girl. This scenario allows for the secretary to refer to the girl as 'my daughter' without any contradiction.
SP-66	3	0	2	The poison needed time to dissolve, which means that Maria, who took longer to finish her drink, allowed the poison to dissolve and take effect, while Juliana, who drank quickly, may not have given the poison enough time to dissolve in her drink before finishing it. Therefore, only Maria was affected by the poison.
SP-67	2	0	2	The scenario describes a path that forms a triangle, which suggests that the starting point is at the North Pole. The only bears that live in the Arctic region, where the North Pole is located, are polar bears, which are white. Therefore, the bear inside the tent would be white.
SP-68	1	0	1	The man is a barber, which means he shaves other people throughout the day. This allows him to maintain a long beard on his own face while still shaving others, making this option the most logical answer.
SP-69	3	0	3	The phrase 'took one shot that got them all' is a play on words. The rancher took a panoramic photo, which captures all the cows in one shot, rather than using a firearm. The other options imply shooting with a gun, which does not fit the context of the riddle.
SP-70	1	0	1	The man was born on February 29th, which only occurs every four years. Therefore, he would celebrate his birthday only once every four years, making it possible for him to be 25 years old in terms of actual birthdays celebrated while having lived for 100 years.
SP-71	1	0	1	The statement makes sense if Mrs. Adams' son was born on February 29, which only occurs in leap years. If he turns 16 today, it means he has had only 4 actual birthdays (16 years divided by 4 years per leap year). Therefore, next year, he will celebrate his 17th birthday, and in the following leap year, he will turn 20. This is the only logical explanation among the options provided.
SP-74	1	0	1	The dog crossed the river without getting wet because the river was frozen, allowing the dog to walk across the ice.
SP-75	3	0	3	The woman's suspicion arises from the fact that if the man genuinely believed it was his hotel room, he would have attempted to open the door rather than knock on it first. This behavior suggests that he may not have been telling the truth, leading her to call security.
SP-77	1	0	1	Sally can wait for the colder months when the lake freezes over, allowing her to walk across the ice to transport the materials to the island. This is a practical solution given her lack of a boat or plane, and it takes advantage of the seasonal change in her environment.
SP-81	3	0	2	The boy could have kicked the soccer ball ten feet away while it is attached to a rope, allowing it to come back to him after being kicked. This is the only option that logically explains how the ball could return to him after being kicked.
SP-82	3	0	3	The scenario describes a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter. In this case, there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the mother and the daughter), which accounts for the two mothers and two daughters mentioned. Therefore, only three people are present, and they collectively ate three slices of pizza, which explains why only three slices were eaten.
SP-83	1	0	1	The car's driver knew the man was there because it was daytime, which would make it easier to see him despite his all-black clothing. In daylight, visibility is generally better, allowing the driver to spot the man even without the car's lights on.
SP-84	3	0	3	The statement suggests that there is one more penny in 1968 than in 1967, which is a play on words. It implies that the quantity of pennies produced in 1968 is greater, making them more valuable in a humorous sense. The other options do not provide a logical reason for the value difference.
SP-88	1	0	1	New Year's Day (January 1) always comes before Christmas (December 25) in any given year. Therefore, the most recent year in which New Year's came before Christmas is indeed this year.
SP-89	1	0	2	If the vice president were to die, the next in line for the presidency is the Speaker of the House, according to the Presidential Succession Act. The President remains in office unless they also die, and Cabinet members do not assume the presidency unless they are next in line after the Speaker.
SP-91	1	0	1	The riddle plays on the interpretation of the word 'three.' It suggests that all months have three letters in their names when spelled out in a different context. However, the answer is more about the play on words rather than the actual number of letters in the month names. Therefore, the correct answer is that they all do, as the riddle implies a trick rather than a straightforward count of letters.
SP-92	3	0	3	Sandy could be referring to an ocean depicted on a map, which does not contain any water. This interpretation aligns with her claim of seeing an ocean without water, making it a logical and honest statement.
SP-93	2	0	2	The statement mentions that not a single hair was wet, which implies that the cat does not have any hair to get wet. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that it was a hairless cat.
SP-94	3	0	3	The statement indicates that both men ended up on the south side of the river. If one person was already on the south side, then the other man could simply join him, making it possible for both to be on the south side without needing to cross the river together in the boat.
SP-95	3	0	3	The girl went over to the U.S. on the 4th of July and returned on a boat named 'July 4'. This means she could have traveled on the same date, fulfilling the condition of being away for 3 days while still returning on the 4th of July, as the name of the boat indicates the date.
SP-96	3	0	1	The riddle implies that Brother 8 is not mentioned in the activities of the other brothers, which suggests he is likely doing something similar to Brother 7, who is sleeping. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Brother 8 is also sleeping.
SP-97	3	0	3	The man lived in a lighthouse, and forgetting to turn on the light would have dire consequences, such as a ship crashing into the rocks. This would lead to deep self-blame because he would feel responsible for the accident and the potential loss of life or damage caused by his oversight.
SP-98	3	0	3	David's birthday is in December, which is during the summer season in Australia. Therefore, it is never in the winter for him, as the seasons are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere.
SP-99	2	0	2	The player scored in their own goal, which means he was actually helping the opposing team rather than contributing to his own team's success. This would understandably lead to his teammates scolding him despite his scoring multiple goals, as scoring for the other team is detrimental to their chances of winning.
SP-100	2	0	2	The two girls can be born at the same hour of the same day and month but in different years, which means they are not twins. This scenario allows them to share the same birthday without being considered twins, as twins are defined as siblings born at the same time in the same year.
SP-101	1	0	3	The reflection by the sea allows him to see his own footstep without turning back. The water can create a reflective surface that shows his footprints, making it possible for him to see them as he walks along the beach.
SP-102	1	0	1	The first option states that they can just walk out as it's daytime outside the cave. This is the most logical solution since it implies that they are not trapped in the cave indefinitely and can exit without needing a light source. The other options involve actions that do not guarantee an exit and may exacerbate their fears.
SP-103	2	0	2	The term 'doctor' can refer to someone who holds a doctorate or is highly educated in a specific field, not necessarily a medical doctor. Therefore, the woman's sons could be 'doctors' in an academic sense, such as having PhDs or other doctoral degrees, without having attended medical school.
SP-104	1	0	1	The most logical explanation is that the well is dry. If the well has no water in it, then the girl would not get wet despite falling into it.
SP-105	3	0	3	The statement describes a scenario where a 'stone' grows and produces fruit. In botanical terms, the seed of a cherry is often referred to as a 'stone' due to its hard outer shell. Therefore, if the 'stone' mentioned is actually a cherry seed, it makes sense that it could be buried in the ground, grow into a cherry tree, and produce fruit. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for the phenomenon described.
SP-107	2	0	2	Roosters are male chickens and do not lay eggs. Therefore, the scenario presented is impossible, and the question of which side the egg would roll on is irrelevant since no egg would be laid in the first place.
SP-108	1	0	1	A single-story house does not have any stairs, as it only has one level. Therefore, the question of what color the stairs are is irrelevant, making option 1 the best answer.
SP-109	2	0	2	The scenario describes three individuals: a grandfather (who is also a father), his son (who is also a father), and the grandson (who is a son). This means there are two fathers and two sons, but only three people in total. Therefore, they can share the three fish, with each person getting one fish.
SP-110	1	0	1	The bus driver didn't break any traffic laws because he was walking. The scenario describes actions that would typically violate traffic laws if he were driving, but since he was on foot, those laws do not apply.
SP-111	3	0	3	The shopkeeper's statement that the parrot repeats everything it hears is technically true if the parrot is deaf. If the parrot cannot hear anything, it cannot repeat anything, which explains why it did not speak during the two weeks Davey had it. Therefore, the shopkeeper did not lie about the parrot's abilities.
SP-112	3	0	1	The riddle plays on the idea of 'legs' referring to the number of legs of people or objects. When you leave the room with two legs (your own), if you bring another man back with you, you now have a total of six legs (two from you and four from the other man). This is the most straightforward interpretation of the riddle.
SP-113	2	0	2	All months have at least 28 days. While February is the only month that has exactly 28 days in non-leap years, every month has 28 days as part of their total days. Therefore, the correct answer is that they all do.
SP-114	2	0	2	The two students can be born on the same day of the same month but in different years, which means they are not siblings. This scenario allows them to share the same birthday while still being separate individuals.
SP-115	2	0	2	The scenario describes a man whose suit was torn, which implies a situation where the integrity of the suit is crucial for survival. The only option that fits this context is that he was an astronaut on a space walk, doing repairs. In space, a torn suit would expose him to the vacuum of space, leading to a rapid loss of life due to lack of oxygen and pressure, which explains why he died three minutes later.
SP-116	3	0	3	Standing back to back allows both you and your friend to be in a position where each of you is physically behind the other. This is the only option that logically satisfies the condition of both standing behind each other simultaneously.
SP-118	1	0	1	The only logical explanation for the driver being able to see the boy, despite the lack of light and the boy's dark clothing, is that it was during the daylight hours. In daylight, visibility is sufficient to see objects and people even without additional light sources.
SP-119	2	0	2	The scenario describes a situation where all four cars can proceed without crashing into each other. If they all make right-hand turns, they can move forward simultaneously without intersecting paths, as each car will be turning into a different street. This allows for safe movement at the intersection.
SP-124	1	0	3	The man can be 33 years old and still alive if he was born on February 29th, a leap year date that occurs every four years. This means he would have had only 8 actual birthdays by the time he turned 33, making it possible for him to be alive and only have celebrated his birthday 8 times.
SP-125	1	0	1	The most logical explanation is that the man was on a motorcycle. Motorcycles are designed to operate with only two wheels, and it is common for them to lean into corners, which can result in only two wheels being on the pavement at times. Therefore, the policeman would not have given a ticket because the man was not breaking any traffic laws by riding a motorcycle.
SP-126	2	0	3	The phrase 'they played for gold and not for fun' suggests that the men were engaged in a game where money is involved, which aligns with poker. In poker, players can win money from each other, and it is possible for all players to end up with a profit if they are playing against a larger pool of players or if they are playing in a way that allows for redistribution of winnings. Thus, the paradox is explained by the nature of poker where players can gain without anyone necessarily losing.
SP-127	3	0	3	Johnny managed to cross the bridge by juggling the gold pieces. Since he only had one piece of gold in his hands at any given time while keeping the other two pieces in the air, his total weight on the bridge at any moment was only 78 kg (his weight) plus the weight of the gold piece he was holding (1 kg), which is 79 kg. This is below the 80 kg limit of the bridge, allowing him to cross safely.
