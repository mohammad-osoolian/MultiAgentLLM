Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this?\n1. Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.\n2. Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back.\n3. The newspaper was folded multiple times and ended with a special shape."}

{"role": "user", "content": "A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.\nHow is this possible?\n1. The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.\n2. The rope is not tied to anything else.\n3. The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n   \"option_id\": \"2\",\n   \"explanation\": \"The horse is able to reach the hay if the rope is not tied to anything else, as this means the horse can move freely in any direction and simply walk towards the hay, rather than being restricted by a stationary point.\"\n}"}
