The phrase 'Dumbass Broncos fans' indicates a direct criticism of a particular group, reinforcing feelings of annoyance with their perspective. Overall, the structure of the sentence, coupled with the sarcastic tone and judgmental language, underlines the speaker\u2019s vexation about the ongoing discussions regarding Peyton\u2019s abilities in the context of the playoffs.
