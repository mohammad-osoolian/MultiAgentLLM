Disgust (12) is relevant because of the derogatory nature of the comment, and disappointment (10) reflects the unmet expectation of a respectful exchange. Embarrassment (13) may also be present but is less certain in this context compared to the other emotions. Therefore, my initial response can be simplified without compromising accuracy.\nOther Agent Answers\nAgent 1\nPredictoin: [3, 4, 10, 12, 13]\nExplanation: After reviewing the responses, it seems necessary to include embarrassment (13) as an emotion present in the text. While anger (3), annoyance (4), disgust (12), and disappointment (10) are clearly conveyed due to the insult and the circumstances surrounding it, embarrassment (13) naturally arises when someone is publicly derogated, adding another layer to the emotional response. Therefore, the additional emotion captures the full extent of the reaction to the situation.\n"}
