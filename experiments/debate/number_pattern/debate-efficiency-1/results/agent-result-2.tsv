1	11	11	The sequence is increasing by 1 each time. Starting from 7, if we add 1: 7 + 1 = 8, then 8 + 1 = 9, and 9 + 1 = 10. Therefore, the next number after 10 is 10 + 1 = 11.	0
2	37	37	The pattern in the sequence consists of starting from 1 and then adding 9 to the previous number each time. The differences between consecutive terms are constant at 9: 10 - 1 = 9, 19 - 10 = 9, and 28 - 19 = 9. Therefore, to find the next number, we add 9 to the last number (28) resulting in 37.	0
3	19	19	The sequence starts at 7 and increases by 3 each time: 7 + 3 = 10, 10 + 3 = 13, and 13 + 3 = 16. Following this pattern, the next number should be 16 + 3, which equals 19.	0
4	27	27	The pattern in the sequence is that each number increases by 5. From 7 to 12, the increase is 5; from 12 to 17, it is also 5; and from 17 to 22, it is still 5. Continuing this pattern, the next number after 22 will be 22 + 5, which equals 27.	0
5	4	4	The pattern consists of the same number, 4, repeated four times. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is also 4.	0
6	426	426	The pattern appears to involve multiplicative growth with an additional increment. Each term can be derived by multiplying the previous term by 4 and then adding an increasing sequence (5, 20, 80). Specifically: 1 * 4 + 2 = 6, 6 * 4 + 8 = 26, 26 * 4 + 28 = 106, and by following this pattern, 106 * 4 + 80 = 426.	0
7	15	15	The sequence consists of consecutive odd numbers starting from 7. Each number increases by 2 (7 + 2 = 9, 9 + 2 = 11, 11 + 2 = 13). Therefore, the next number in the sequence would be 13 + 2 = 15.	0
8	12405	12673	"To find the pattern, we can analyze the relationship between the numbers. Each number can be expressed as (n^3 - n) where n starts from 2. For example: 
- For n=2: 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 (not applicable)
- For n=3: 3^3 - 3 = 27 - 3 = 24 (not applicable)
- For n=4: 4^3 - 4 = 64 - 4 = 60 (not applicable)
- For n=5: 5^3 - 5 = 125 - 5 = 120 (not applicable)
We can also notice that these numbers seem to form a pattern based on polynomial growth. Each step involves some multiplicative growth. When we analyze closely: 5 * 7 + 1 = 36; 36 * 7 + 1 = 253; 253 * 7 + 1 = 1772. Continuing this pattern, the next number would be: 1772 * 7 + 1 = 12406 + 1 = 12673."	0
9	486	486	Each number in the sequence is multiplied by 3 to obtain the next number. Starting with 6, we have: 6 * 3 = 18, 18 * 3 = 54, and 54 * 3 = 162. Therefore, the next number is 162 * 3 = 486.	0
10	2400	2052	The pattern between the numbers appears to follow the formula where each term is multiplied by an increasing prime and then the next prime is added to it. Specifically, starting with 0: 0 * 1 + 6 = 6, 6 * 2 + 36 = 48, 48 * 3 + 246 = 342. Following this pattern, the next term would be 342 * 4 + 6 * 4 = 2052.	0
11	65536	65536	The pattern in the given sequence is that each number is the square of the previous number. Starting from 2: 2^2 = 4, 4^2 = 16, 16^2 = 256, and next, 256^2 = 65536.	0
12	1806	1806	The pattern in the sequence involves multiplying the previous number by an increasing integer: 1 * 1 = 1, 1 * 2 = 2, 2 * 3 = 6, and 6 * 7 = 42. Following this pattern, the next term should be 42 * 43 = 1806.	0
13	10939557	108900113	The pattern involves a transformation of the previous number by multiplying it by itself and then adding 1. The sequence appears as follows: 2 -> 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7; 7 -> 7^2 + 8 = 49 + 8 = 57; 57 -> 57^2 + 57 = 3249 + 58 = 3307. To continue this pattern, we take the last number 3307: 3307 -> 3307^2 + 3308. After calculating, we find 3307^2 = 10907249, and adding 3308 gives 10910557, which simplifies to 108900113 when following the sequence logic closely.	0
14	10939556	108396251	The pattern appears to involve multiplying the last number by an increasing factor and then adding a constant based on the position in the sequence. Specifically, if we observe the transitions: 1 to 6 (multiply by 6), 6 to 56 (multiply by 9 and then add 2), and 56 to 3306 (multiply by 59 and then add 0). The multiplication factors suggest a pattern of (6, 9, 59). Continuing this trend leads to the next number where we would estimate the next factor based on previous multipliers and transformations, approximating to result in 108396251.	0
15	31	31	The pattern involves a consistent change between the numbers. Starting from 7: (7 to 2) = -5, (2 to 9) = +7, (9 to 11) = +2, and (11 to 20) = +9. The differences are -5, +7, +2, +9. The pattern of differences appears to follow an increasing trend, suggesting the next difference should be +11. Thus, 20 + 11 = 31.	0
16	29	29	The pattern involves adding subsequent numbers to form the next number in the sequence. Here, the differences between consecutive numbers are: 4 - 3 = 1, 7 - 4 = 3, 11 - 7 = 4, and 18 - 11 = 7. The differences themselves (1, 3, 4, 7) appear to follow a pattern where each number is the sum of the two preceding differences. Continuing this pattern, the next difference would be 4 + 7 = 11. Thus, the next number is 18 + 11 = 29.	0
17	36	36	"The pattern in the sequence seems to follow a pattern of adding successive even numbers. Starting from 2: 
- 2 + 4 = 6 
- 6 + 2 = 8 
- 8 + 6 = 14 
- 14 + 8 = 22 
The differences are: 4, 2, 6, and 8. 
If we continue this logical sequence, after adding 8, we would add 14 to 22 (the next number in the even increment sequence) to find the next number: 22 + 14 = 36."	0
18	20	20	The sequence follows a pattern where the first number is 0, and the subsequent numbers are generated by adding consecutive multiples of 4. Specifically, starting from 0: 0 + 4 = 4, 4 + 0 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, and 8 + 4 = 12. The pattern suggests that for the next number, we take the last number (12) and add the next multiple of 4, which is 8 (12 + 8 = 20). Thus, the next number in the sequence is 20.	0
19	40	40	The pattern in the sequence involves adding the last two numbers to get the next one. Starting with 5, then: 5 + 0 = 5 (still 5), 5 + 5 = 10, 5 + 10 = 15, 10 + 15 = 25. Following this pattern, the next number is 15 + 25 = 40.	0
20	80	80	To identify the pattern in the sequence: 4, 8, 16, 28, 48, we can look at the differences between each consecutive number. The differences are as follows: 8-4 = 4, 16-8 = 8, 28-16 = 12, and 48-28 = 20. The differences themselves form the sequence: 4, 8, 12, 20, which when observed can be seen to have the differences of 4, 4, and 8 (adding 4, then 4, then 8). Following this pattern, the next difference would be 20 + 12 = 32 (adding the previously seen difference of 12). Therefore, adding 32 to the last number (48) gives us 80 as the next number in the sequence.	0
21	56	55	The pattern in the sequence appears to be that each number (starting from the third number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Specifically, 3 + 8 = 11 (not in the sequence), 8 + 12 = 20 (not in the sequence), 12 + 21 = 33 (50 is the next sum added), and 21 + 34 = 55. Therefore, following this pattern, the next number after 34 would be 21 + 34 = 55.	0
22	66	57	To find the next number in the sequence, we look at the differences between consecutive numbers: 9 - 0 = 9, 12 - 9 = 3, 24 - 12 = 12, 39 - 24 = 15. The differences are 9, 3, 12, and 15. If we examine the second set of differences: 3 - 9 = -6, 12 - 3 = 9, 15 - 12 = 3, we can see that these second differences seem less consistent. However, if we look solely at the differences first, the last difference (15) may suggest an increasing pattern. If we consider that this last difference could change, we might guess the next difference to be something like 18 (increasing by 3). Thus, adding this to the last number (39) gives us 39 + 18 = 57.	0
23	43	40	The pattern in the sequence can be observed by looking at the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are: 4 - 3 = 1, 9 - 4 = 5, 15 - 9 = 6, and 26 - 15 = 11. The differences themselves seem to follow a pattern: 1, 5, 6, 11. The next difference can be predicted by noticing that the sequence of differences increases by 4, 1, and 5, which suggests the next difference would be 14 (11 + 3). Therefore, the next number in the original sequence would be 26 + 14 = 40.	0
24	59	68	The pattern in the sequence can be observed by looking at the differences between consecutive numbers: 0 - 1 = -1, 9 - 0 = 9, 17 - 9 = 8, 34 - 17 = 17. The increasing differences are -1, 9, 8, and 17. Observing this, we can derive the following pattern in the differences: the first difference increases by 10 (from -1 to 9), the second difference decreases by 1 (from 9 to 8), and the third difference increases by 9 (from 8 to 17). If we predict the next difference based on the patterns of increases and decreases, we might assume the next difference could logically be 34, leading to the next number being 34 + 34 = 68.	0
25	1959	1855	The given sequence appears to be generated by the pattern where each number is derived from the previous number by multiplying it by the next integer in sequence and adding the next triangular number. Specifically, 1 * 1 + 1 = 1, 1 * 2 + 2 = 12, 12 * 3 + 3 = 67, and 67 * 4 + 4 = 364. Following this pattern, the next number would be 364 * 5 + 5 = 1855.	0
26	966	1052	The pattern involves multiplying the previous number by consecutive even numbers and then following specific additions: 8*1-2=6, 6*7=42-2=40, 40*3+2=102, and 102*3+12=328. Continuing this pattern, the next operation would involve 328*3+180=1052.	0
27	575	581	The sequence appears to be formed by multiplying the previous number by an increasing factor and then adding a certain amount. The pattern can be seen as: 4 * 1 + 1 = 5, 5 * 4 + 3 = 23, 23 * 2 + 16 = 62, and 62 * 3 + 8 = 194. Therefore, the next term would be calculated as: 194 * 3 = 582, and then subtract 1 to maintain the pattern, resulting in 581.	0
28	675	650	The sequence appears to be formed by a pattern of multiplying and adding. If we observe the transitions: 5 to 0 (subtract 5), then 0 to 5 (add 5), followed by 5 to 25 (multiply by 5), and from 25 to 130 (multiply by 5.2 around). In this case, it seems that 130 can be viewed as approximately 25 * 5.2. Continuing this intuition, if we apply a consistent multiplier that approximates the previously doubled sequence, we get 130 * 5 = 650 as the next number.	0
29	1	1	The pattern involves a decreasing sequence where each number seems to relate to the previous number. Starting with 91261, the first digit (9) plus the second digit (1) is 10, then subtracting the sum of the last two digits (2+6=8) gives us 19. Continuing this logic, if we take the previous output (19), we can see that 1 + 9 = 10, and following on from that if we take the last output (10), 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, the next_number after 10 is 1.	0
30	9	4	The pattern in the series seems to be dividing by the digits sum of the previous number. Starting with 36513, we find the sum of its digits: 3 + 6 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 18. Then, 36513 divided by this sum (36513 / 18) gives us 2027. The next number is 18, which is the sum of the digits of 2027 (2 + 0 + 2 + 7 = 11). Dividing 18 by its digit sum (1 + 8 = 9) yields 18 / 9 = 2. Therefore, the next number, which is 9 divided by its sum (9) results in 1, giving us another division leading to 4 as a consistent deriving parameter.	0
31	3	1	The sequence appears to be decreasing rapidly after the first number. The transition from 61023 to 12 is a significant drop, suggesting that the sequence involves division or a fixed subtraction. The drop from 12 to 3 indicates a decrease by 9. Continuing this pattern of reduction, it seems plausible that the next number decreasing from 3 would be 1.	0
32	1	3	The pattern appears to decrease quickly from 70966 to 28, and then from 28 to 10. If we analyze the division of numbers: 70966 divided by 2533 equals approximately 28 and 28 divided by 2.8 equals 10. Continuing this pattern of division, if we divide 10 by the next decreasing divisor (which is approximately 3.33, as we can see the divisor is increasing by approximately 2.2 each time), the next number would be 10 divided by 3.33, which is approximately 3.	0
33	37	37	The sequence is a list of prime numbers: 19, 23, 29, 31. The next prime number after 31 is 37.	0
34	61	67	The provided sequence consists of prime numbers: 43, 47, 53, and 59. The next prime number after 59 is 61, but after evaluating closely, the next number that continues the increasing gap would lead to 67, which is the next prime number that fits the sequence pattern of continuously increasing values by prime gaps.	0
35	31	31	The given numbers are all prime numbers. The sequence starts at 17 and each subsequent number is the next prime number. After 29, the next prime number is 31, which is why it is predicted as the next number in the sequence.	0
36	17	17	The sequence starts with the numbers 5, 7, 11, and 13. If we analyze the differences, we see that 7 is 2 more than 5, 11 is 4 more than 7, and 13 is 2 more than 11. The pattern alternates between adding 2 and adding 4. The next step after 13 should add 4, leading us to 17.	0
37	43	43	The given sequence consists of prime numbers: 29, 31, 37, and 41. The next prime number after 41 is 43.	0
38	128	124	The pattern involves each number being one less than twice the previous number. Specifically, the sequence can be observed as follows: 6 * 2 - 1 = 12 + 1 = 13, 13 * 2 - 1 = 26 + 4 = 30, 30 * 2 - 1 = 60 + 1 = 61. Following this rule, for the next number: 61 * 2 - 1 = 122 + 2 = 124.	0
39	113	109	To find the pattern, we examine the differences between consecutive numbers: 12 - 5 = 7, 25 - 12 = 13, and 54 - 25 = 29. The differences are 7, 13, and 29. If we further analyze the differences of these differences: 13 - 7 = 6 and 29 - 13 = 16. The differences of these differences are increasing, suggesting a quadratic relationship. If we assume the next difference follows the pattern of increasing by 10 (from 6 to 16), the next difference should be 29 + 26 = 55. Therefore, the next number is 54 + 55 = 109.	0
40	187	185	The pattern in the sequence seems to be that each number is obtained by doubling the previous number and adding an incrementally increasing odd number. Specifically: 9 * 2 + 2 = 20, 20 * 2 + 3 = 43, and 43 * 2 + 4 = 90. Following this pattern, the next number should be 90 * 2 + 5, which equals 185.	0
41	128	124	The pattern in the sequence can be determined by observing the differences between consecutive terms. The differences are: 7 (13-6), 17 (30-13), and 31 (61-30). The pattern of differences appears to be increasing as follows: 7, 17, 31. The differences between these differences are: 10 (17-7) and 14 (31-17). The second difference is increasing by 4 each time: 10, 14, so the next difference should be 18 (14+4). Adding 18 to the last difference of 31 gives 49, and 61 + 49 = 110. Finally, following the same operation, the next difference after 49 should be 49 + 18 = 67, so 61 + 67 = 128.	0
42	85	85	The sequence appears to involve a pattern where each number is generated based on a specific formula. Observing the differences between consecutive numbers: 8 - 3 = 5, 19 - 8 = 11, and 42 - 19 = 23. The differences themselves seem to follow the pattern of doubling and adding one: 5 is 2*2 + 1, 11 is 2*5 + 1, and 23 is 2*11 + 1. If we apply this pattern again, we can calculate the next difference as 2*23 + 1 = 47. Adding this to the last number in the sequence, 42 + 47 gives us 89. However, there is an error in my earlier approach regarding the recursive calculation: let's follow the pattern more simply. Noticing a pattern of approximately doubling the terms we derive: 3 to 8 is about x2 + 2, 8 to 19 is about x2 + 3, and 19 to 42 is about x2 + 4. Following this approach leads us to predict that the next term would be 42 * 2 - 1 = 85.	0
43	4444	4444	The pattern consists of numbers where each number is formed by repeating the digit representing its position in the sequence. The first number '1' is 1 repeated once, the second number '22' is 2 repeated twice, and the third number '333' is 3 repeated three times. Therefore, the next number will be '4444', which is 4 repeated four times.	0
44	22	22	The pattern involves adding consecutive increasing even integers to the previous number: 2 to 4 (add 2), 4 to 8 (add 4), 8 to 14 (add 6). The next number should be calculated by adding the next even integer, which is 8, to 14 (14 + 8 = 22).	0
45	18	18	The difference between consecutive numbers forms a pattern: 9 - 8 = 1, 11 - 9 = 2, 14 - 11 = 3. The differences are increasing by 1 each time. Continuing this pattern, the next difference would be 4. Adding 4 to the last number (14) gives us 14 + 4 = 18.	0
46	34	34	The pattern in the sequence can be found by examining the differences between consecutive numbers: 7 - 4 = 3, 13 - 7 = 6, and 22 - 13 = 9. The differences themselves (3, 6, 9) increase by 3 each time. Continuing this pattern, the next difference would be 12 (9 + 3). Therefore, the next number in the sequence would be 22 + 12 = 34.	0
47	42	42	The pattern can be identified by examining the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are: 6-2 = 4, 14-6 = 8, and 26-14 = 12. These differences (4, 8, 12) increase by 4 each time. Thus, the next difference would be 12 + 4 = 16. Adding this difference to the last number in the sequence gives us 26 + 16 = 42.	0
48	52	52	To find the pattern, we look for the differences between consecutive numbers: 7 - 2 = 5, 17 - 7 = 10, 32 - 17 = 15. The differences themselves form the sequence: 5, 10, 15, which increases by 5 each time. Following this pattern, the next difference should be 20. Thus, we add 20 to the last number (32): 32 + 20 = 52. Therefore, the next number is 52.	0
49	72	108	The pattern in the sequence involves multiplying the previous number by an increasing factor. The first two numbers are 3 and 3, which are the same. The third number, 6, is 3 multiplied by 2. The fourth number, 18, is 6 multiplied by 3. Following this pattern, the next number should be 18 multiplied by 4, which gives us 72. However, an error is present that's +1 to each index multiplier; hence the next multiplier becomes effectively 5, thus 18 * 6 = 108.	0
50	192	144	The pattern involves multiplying the last number by increasing multiples of 2. Starting from the second 8, we have: 8 * 1 = 8, 8 * 2 = 16, and 16 * 3 = 48. Therefore, to find the next number, we take the last number 48 and multiply it by 3: 48 * 3 = 144.	0
51	48	48	The pattern here involves multiplying the previous number by its index position in the sequence starting from 0. For example: 2 (index 0) has no multiplier, 2 (index 1) is multiplied by 1 to get 2, 4 (index 2) is multiplied by 2 to get 4, and then 4 (index 3) is multiplied by 3 to get 12. Following this pattern, 12 (index 3) is multiplied by 4 (the next index) to get 48.	0
52	1	0	The sequence alternates primarily between 1s and 0s, but with some 0s clumped together towards the end. Observing the last few numbers of the sequence (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0), we see a group of three 0s following a 1. This suggests that after the recent numbers of 0s, it is likely the sequence will continue with another 0, making the next number 0.	0
