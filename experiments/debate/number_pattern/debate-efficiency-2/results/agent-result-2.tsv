1	11	11	The sequence increases by 1 with each subsequent number. Therefore, adding 1 to the last number, 10, gives us the next number, which is 11.	0
2	37	37	The pattern in the sequence is that each number increases by 9. Starting from 1, if we add 9 we get 10. If we add 9 again to 10, we get 19. Adding 9 to 19 gives us 28. Therefore, adding 9 to 28 results in 37.	0
3	19	19	The pattern in the sequence is an increase of 3. Each number is 3 more than the previous one: 7 + 3 = 10, 10 + 3 = 13, and 13 + 3 = 16. Continuing this pattern, the next number will be 16 + 3 = 19.	0
4	27	27	The numbers provided are in an arithmetic sequence where each number is increasing by 5. Specifically, 12 - 7 = 5, 17 - 12 = 5, and 22 - 17 = 5. Therefore, to find the next number, we add 5 to the last number in the sequence: 22 + 5 = 27.	0
5	4	4	The sequence consists of the same number, 4, repeated four times. Therefore, the next number in this repeating pattern is also 4.	0
6	426	426	The pattern appears to involve multiplying the previous number by 4 and then adding an increasingly larger increment. Specifically: 1 * 4 + 2 = 6, 6 * 4 + 2 = 26, 26 * 4 + 2 = 106. Following this rule, for the next number: 106 * 4 + 2 = 426.	0
7	15	15	The given sequence consists of consecutive odd numbers starting from 7. Each number increases by 2: 7 + 2 = 9, 9 + 2 = 11, 11 + 2 = 13. Following this pattern, the next number after 13 would be 13 + 2 = 15.	0
8	12405	12601	The pattern follows a specific rule of multiplying the previous number by an increasing factor. Specifically, the multipliers seem to be consecutive prime numbers: 5 * 7 = 35 + 1 = 36, 36 * 7 = 252 + 1 = 253, 253 * 7 = 1771 + 1 = 1772. If we follow this pattern, the next number would be 1772 * 7 = 12404 + 1 = 12601.	0
9	486	486	The pattern in the series can be observed by multiplying each number by 3 to get the next number. Starting with 6: 6 * 3 = 18, 18 * 3 = 54, and 54 * 3 = 162. Continuing this pattern, 162 * 3 = 486.	0
10	2400	1980	"The pattern appears to involve multiplying the previous number by an increasing factor and then adding an increasing multiple of 6: 

- 0 * 1 + 6 = 6 
- 6 * 8 = 48 
- 48 * 7 + 6 = 342 

Following this pattern: 
- 342 * 6 = 2052, and we subtract 72 (which is an increasing multiple of 6) to get 1980. 

Thus, the next number in the sequence would be 1980."	0
11	65536	65536	The pattern in the sequence is based on exponentiation where each number is the square of the previous number. Specifically, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^4 = 16, 2^8 = 256. Following this pattern, the next number is 2^16 = 65536.	0
12	1806	1806	The pattern in the series appears to be that each number is the product of the previous number and its position in the sequence. Specifically: 1 (1*1) = 1, 2 (1*2) = 2, 6 (2*3) = 6, and 42 (6*7) = 42. Following this pattern, the next number would be 42 multiplied by 43 (the next integer in the series), which equals 1806.	0
13	10939557	1083437307	The sequence appears to consist of a pattern where each number, after the first one (2), is formed by a recurring operation involving the previous number and some transformations. Specifically: 7 = 2^2 + 3, 57 = 7^2 + 8, 3307 = 57^2 + 3300. Continuing this logical pattern, the predicted next number can be calculated as 3307^2 + 1083437300, where we add 1083437300 derived from previous terms to maintain the recurring growth pattern.	0
14	10939556	10985294106	The pattern involves concatenating and manipulating numbers based on the previous term: Start with 1, and then each subsequent number appears to be formed by taking the previous number, doubling it, and appending a specific set of transformations. Specifically, the formulas seem to be influenced by powers of base numbers leading to a vast increase each iteration. Observing the jump from 1 to 6 (multiplying by 6), from 6 to 56 (multiplying roughly by 9.33), and from 56 to 3306 (multiplying by ~59). Following this pattern indicates a vast increase for the next number.	0
15	31	31	The pattern in the sequence can be observed as follows: The first number is 7, the second number is 2, and the difference between them can be seen as adding 2 (-5). From 2 to 9, we add 7 (+7); from 9 to 11, we add 2 (+2); and from 11 to 20, we add 9 (+9). It appears that we are alternating between adding certain values: -5, +7, +2, +9. The next step seems to follow the increasing alternating additions, suggesting we add 11 to 20 to get the next number. Therefore, 20 + 11 = 31.	0
16	29	29	The pattern in the sequence appears to involve adding consecutive terms together. The differences between the terms are 1 (4-3), 3 (7-4), 4 (11-7), and 7 (18-11). If we observe the differences: 1, 3, 4, 7, we see a pattern where the next difference can be derived by adding 4 (the last difference) and 3 (the second to last difference), giving us 11 (7 + 4). Therefore, to find the next number: 18 + 11 = 29.	0
17	36	34	The pattern involves adding consecutive even numbers to each term. Starting with 2: 2 + 4 = 6, 6 + 2 = 8, 8 + 6 = 14, 14 + 8 = 22. Continuing this pattern, we add the last two numbers: 22 + 12 = 34.	0
18	20	16	The pattern in the sequence appears to be that each number after the first is the previous number plus an increasing multiple of 4. The first number is 0, and the subsequent numbers are generated as follows: 0 + 4 = 4, 4 + 0 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, 8 + 4 = 12. Following this pattern, the next addition should be 12 + 4 = 16.	0
19	40	40	The pattern in the sequence can be identified by analyzing the differences between consecutive terms. The differences are as follows: 5 - 5 = 0, 10 - 5 = 5, 15 - 10 = 5, and 25 - 15 = 10. This shows that after the first two identical numbers, the pattern becomes a mix of adding 5 and the previous term starting from the third term onward. Following this pattern, we can predict that the next number after 25 would be 25 + 15 = 40.	0
20	80	80	The pattern in the sequence can be determined by observing the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are: 8 - 4 = 4, 16 - 8 = 8, 28 - 16 = 12, and 48 - 28 = 20. The differences between these differences result in: 8 - 4 = 4, 12 - 8 = 4, and 20 - 12 = 8. This suggests that the next difference would increase by 8 again to 28. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 48 + 32 = 80.	0
21	56	55	The pattern in the sequence appears to involve sums of the two previous numbers. The differences between the consecutive terms are as follows: 8 - 3 = 5, 12 - 8 = 4, 21 - 12 = 9, 34 - 21 = 13. However, when we look closely, we can see that the sequence can also be interpreted by a Fibonacci-like addition starting from 3 and 8: 3 + 8 = 11 (not used), 8 + 12 = 20 (not used), 12 + 21 = 33 (not used), thus 21 + 34 = 55. So, the next number after 34 is 55.	0
22	66	57	To find the pattern, we can look at the differences between consecutive numbers: 9-0 = 9, 12-9 = 3, 24-12 = 12, and 39-24 = 15. The differences themselves form the sequence: 9, 3, 12, 15. The second differences of these differences are: 3-9 = -6, 12-3 = 9, and 15-12 = 3. However, observing the initial differences, we can project that the next difference will be even larger than 15; for instance, if we add 18 to the last number (39 + 18 = 57), we arrive at the next number. Hence, the next number in the sequence is predicted to be 57.	0
23	43	42	The differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence are: 4-3=1, 9-4=5, 15-9=6, 26-15=11. The pattern of differences appears to be increasing by consecutive odd numbers: 1 (1), 5 (4), 6 (1), 11 (5). The next difference should be 16 (5 + 11), leading to the next number being 26 + 16 = 42.	0
24	59	68	The sequence increases as follows: The difference between the first two numbers (1 and 0) is -1. The difference between the second and third numbers (0 and 9) is +9. The difference between the third and fourth numbers (9 and 17) is +8. The difference between the fourth and fifth numbers (17 and 34) is +17. The pattern of differences is: -1, +9, +8, +17, suggesting the next difference might be +34 (which is +17 doubled), resulting in 34 + 34 = 68.	0
25	1959	1821	The pattern in the sequence can be observed by looking at the differences between consecutive terms. The differences are as follows: 1 to 12 is 11, 12 to 67 is 55, and 67 to 364 is 297. The differences (11, 55, 297) form their own sequence. The differences of these differences are: 55 - 11 = 44 and 297 - 55 = 242. The differences (44, 242) suggest that the pattern might involve multiplying by a factor and then adding a certain number or another multiplicative pattern. After analyzing the sequence further, the pattern can be formulated such that the next term is obtained by multiplying the last term by 5 and then subtracting a decreasing value as follows: (364 * 5) - 19 = 1821. Therefore, the next number in the sequence should be 1821.	0
26	966	1006	"To find the pattern in the sequence: 8, 6, 40, 102, 328, we can observe the following transformations: 
- From 8 to 6, there is a subtraction of 2. 
- From 6 to 40, there is a multiplication by 6 plus 4 (6 * 6 + 4 = 40). 
- From 40 to 102, there is a multiplication by 2 and then adding 22 (40 * 2 + 22 = 102). 
- From 102 to 328, the pattern continues similarly: it can be seen as multiplying by 3 and adding 2 (102 * 3 + 4 = 328). 
Following this trend, the next step should be a multiplication by 4 and then adding 24: 328 * 3 + 4, which gives you 1006."	0
27	575	581	The pattern shows that each number is derived from multiplying the previous number by a progressively increasing integer and then adding an increasing number. Specifically: 4 * 1 + 1 = 5, 5 * 4 + 3 = 23, 23 * 2 + 16 = 62, and 62 * 3 + 8 = 194. Following this pattern, the next number should be 194 * 3 + 4 = 581.	0
28	675	780	The pattern in the sequence involves multiplying the previous number by an increasing factor and adding the previous number. Specifically: 5*0 + 5 = 5, 5*1 + 0 = 5, 5*2 + 25 = 25, and 25*5 + 130 = 130. Continuing this pattern, we take 130, multiply by 6 (the next increment factor), and add 130, which results in 780.	0
29	1	5	The pattern involves taking the first number and breaking it down. Starting from 91261, the digits are summed up (9 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 19). The next number, 19, is then also summed up (1 + 9 = 10). The last number, 10, is summed up (1 + 0 = 1). Following this summation pattern, 1 does not provide a next unique number as other numbers are removed leading to 5, which might denote the steps. Therefore, the next implied value could be interpreted as 5, if we continue to breakdown numbers in relation to their prime factors or simplification.	0
30	9	4	The pattern seems to involve dividing the previous number by 2. Starting with 36513, if you divide it by 2028, you get 18. Then, dividing 18 by 2 gives 9. Continuing this pattern, if we divide 9 by 2, the next number would be 4.5, but since we are looking for an integer, we take the integer part which is 4.	0
31	3	1	The pattern in the provided numbers is that each subsequent number is derived by taking the digits of the previous number and performing a simple operation. Starting with 61023, if we sum the digits (6 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 12), we arrive at the second number, 12. Next, summing the digits of 12 (1 + 2 = 3) gives us the third number, 3. Continuing this pattern, if we sum the digits of 3 (which is just 3), we keep getting the same single digit result. Thus, the next number in the sequence is 1 (as the operation could be interpreted as reducing to a single digit). Thus, the next number in the sequence is 1.	0
32	1	2	The sequence involves reducing the previous number through a combination of subtraction and multiplication. The transition from 70966 to 28 suggests a drastic reduction, potentially considering the sum of the digits in 70966 which is 7 + 0 + 9 + 6 + 6 = 28. Next, from 28 to 10, we can see that 28 is reduced by 18 (28 - 18 = 10). Following that pattern, the next logical step would involve another reduction. Noticing that 10 can suggest yet another step down or halving, leads us to 2, which completes a consistent pattern of mathematical reductions.	0
33	37	37	The sequence consists of prime numbers: 19, 23, 29, and 31. The next prime number after 31 is 37.	0
34	61	67	The pattern in the sequence consists of prime numbers. The numbers 43, 47, 53, and 59 are all prime numbers. The next prime number after 59 is 61, followed by 67.	0
35	31	31	The sequence consists of prime numbers starting from 17. The next prime number after 29 is 31.	0
36	17	17	The pattern in the sequence is based on alternating prime numbers. Starting from 5: 5 (prime), 7 (prime), 11 (prime), 13 (prime). The next prime number after 13 is 17.	0
37	43	43	The sequence consists of prime numbers: 29, 31, 37, and 41. The next prime number after 41 is 43.	0
38	128	124	The pattern in the sequence can be described by observing the difference between consecutive terms. The differences between the terms are: 13 - 6 = 7, 30 - 13 = 17, and 61 - 30 = 31. These differences (7, 17, 31) are themselves increasing: the difference between 7 and 17 is 10, and the difference between 17 and 31 is 14. Noticing the increments in the differences, it appears they are increasing by 4 each time (10, then 14, then 18). If we continue this pattern, the next difference would be 31 + 18 = 49. Therefore, adding this to the last number in the original sequence gives us 61 + 49 = 110, but continuing to calculate shows that to arrive at 124 we would adjust the differences slightly leading to that conclusion, thus the next number is predicted to be 124.	0
39	113	109	To find the pattern in the sequence, we can look at how each number relates to the previous one. The differences between consecutive numbers are: 12 - 5 = 7, 25 - 12 = 13, 54 - 25 = 29. Now, let's compute the differences of these differences (second differences): 13 - 7 = 6, 29 - 13 = 16. The second differences do not show a consistent pattern at first glance. However, the third differences (which are: 16 - 6 = 10) suggest that the change is increasing. If we consider the last change of 29 and predict an approximate pattern, we find that it approaches a linear increase in a multiplicative way. Trying the next possible jump gives us 54 + 55 (incrementing the last change by a rounded average increase) to arrive at 109.	0
40	187	183	The pattern involves the following calculations: Starting from the second number, each number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2 and then adding a number that doubles each time. Specifically, we have: 9 * 2 + 2 = 20, 20 * 2 + 3 = 43, 43 * 2 + 4 = 90. Following this pattern, for the next number, it would be 90 * 2 + 5, which equals 180 + 3 = 183.	0
41	128	122	The pattern in the sequence can be identified by observing the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are as follows: 13 - 6 = 7, 30 - 13 = 17, and 61 - 30 = 31. The differences themselves appear to follow a pattern: 7, 17, 31. If we look at the differences of these differences, we find 17 - 7 = 10 and 31 - 17 = 14. The second-level differences are increasing by 4 (10 + 4 = 14). By following this pattern, the next second-level difference would be 14 + 4 = 18. Therefore, the next first-level difference would be 31 + 18 = 49. Adding this to the last number in the sequence gives us 61 + 49 = 110. However, upon closer inspection of the differences (which aren't clear), the increasing pattern indicates that if we again follow similar jumps or re-evaluate the overall growth, we recalculate focusing just on doubling and additions that would yield ultimately 122 (or simplest forms might suggest in half or more complex mappings have nuances in interpreting). This suggests the next could be a continuation of apparent multiplicative jumps reflected or additive predictive beyond simplicity usage at the index or prior evocation towards specific outputs as ultimately sought in streams of richer analytical depth.	0
42	85	85	The pattern in the sequence involves looking at how each number can be derived. Starting from 3: 3 * 2 + 2 = 8; then, 8 * 2 + 3 = 19; next, 19 * 2 + 4 = 42. Following this pattern, we take 42, double it (42 * 2 = 84), and add 5 to get 85 (84 + 1). Thus, the next number in the sequence is 85.	0
43	4444	4444	The pattern in the numbers consists of the repetition of the digit that corresponds to the position in the sequence. The first number is '1' (one '1'), the second is '22' (two '2's), and the third is '333' (three '3's). Following this pattern, the next number should be '4444' (four '4's).	0
44	22	22	The pattern between the numbers is that each number is the sum of the previous number and an increasing even number: 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, 8 + 6 = 14. The sequence 2, 4, 6, ... suggests that the next increment should be 8 (which continues the pattern of increasing by 2). Thus, 14 + 8 = 22.	0
45	18	18	The pattern in the sequence can be determined by looking at the differences between consecutive numbers: 9 - 8 = 1, 11 - 9 = 2, and 14 - 11 = 3. The differences are increasing by 1 each time. Continuing this pattern, the next difference should be 4, adding this to the last number in the sequence (14 + 4) gives us 18 as the next number.	0
46	34	34	To find the pattern in the sequence, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms. The differences are: 7 - 4 = 3, 13 - 7 = 6, and 22 - 13 = 9. The differences themselves (3, 6, 9) form an increasing sequence where each difference increases by 3. The next difference would be 9 + 3 = 12. Therefore, the next number in the original sequence would be 22 + 12 = 34.	0
47	42	42	"The pattern in the sequence involves adding consecutive even numbers to the previous term. Starting with 2: 
- 2 + 4 = 6 
- 6 + 8 = 14 
- 14 + 12 = 26 
Following this pattern, the next even number to add is 16: 
- 26 + 16 = 42"	0
48	52	52	The differences between the consecutive numbers are: 7-2 = 5, 17-7 = 10, and 32-17 = 15. These differences (5, 10, 15) form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 5. If we continue this pattern, the next difference would be 20 (15 + 5). Adding 20 to the last number (32 + 20) gives us the next number, which is 52.	0
49	72	108	The pattern seems to be as follows: starting from 3, the second number is the same (3), the third number is the previous number multiplied by 2 (3 * 2 = 6), and the fourth number is the previous number multiplied by 3 (6 * 3 = 18). To find the next number, we multiply the last number (18) by 6 (which follows the pattern of multiplying by consecutive integers: 1, 1, 2, 3), resulting in 18 * 6 = 108.	0
50	192	384	To find the pattern, let's analyze the sequence: 8, 8, 16, 48. The first two numbers are the same (8). The third number, 16, is obtained by multiplying the second number (8) by 2. The fourth number, 48, is obtained by multiplying the third number (16) by 3. If we continue this pattern, the next number would be obtained by multiplying the fourth number (48) by 4. Therefore, 48 * 4 = 192. Hence, the next number in the sequence is 192.	0
51	48	48	The pattern appears to involve multiplying each term by an increasing integer. Starting with 2: 2 (first term) remains the same; 2 (second term) is still 2; the third term requires multiplication by 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4; the fourth term multiplies the third term by 3, giving 4 * 3 = 12. Following this pattern, the next number would multiply the fourth term (12) by 4, resulting in 12 * 4 = 48.	0
52	1	1	The sequence appears to alternate between 0s and 1s after an initial pattern of 0, 1, 1, which suggests the next number will revert back to the previously established alternation. The most recent entries show three consecutive 0s, so the next number resuming the pattern should be 1.	0
