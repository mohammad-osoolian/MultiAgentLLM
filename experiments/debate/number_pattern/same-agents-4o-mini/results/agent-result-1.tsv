1	11	11	The sequence is increasing by 1 each time. Starting from 7, the numbers are 7, 8, 9, 10, which indicates that the next number in the sequence is obtained by adding 1 to the last number (10). Therefore, the next number is 11.	0
2	37	37	The given sequence consists of numbers that increase by 9 each time. The differences between consecutive numbers can be calculated as follows: 10 - 1 = 9, 19 - 10 = 9, and 28 - 19 = 9. Thus, to find the next number in the sequence, we add 9 to the last number, 28. Therefore, the next number is 28 + 9 = 37.	0
3	19	19	The sequence increases by 3 each time. The differences are: 10 - 7 = 3, 13 - 10 = 3, and 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, to find the next number, add 3 to the last number (16): 16 + 3 = 19.	0
4	27	27	The sequence increases by 5 each time: 12 - 7 = 5, 17 - 12 = 5, 22 - 17 = 5. Therefore, to get the next number, we add 5 to the last number: 22 + 5 = 27.	0
5	4	4	The given sequence consists of the same number, which is '4', repeated four times. Since there is no change in the pattern, it is logical to predict that the next number will also be '4', maintaining the consistency of the pattern.	0
6	426	426	The pattern in the sequence can be derived as follows: Each number is formed by multiplying the previous number by 4 and then subtracting a certain number. Specifically: 1 * 4 - 2 = 6, 6 * 4 - 2 = 26, 26 * 4 - 2 = 106. Following this same pattern, the next number would be 106 * 4 - 2 = 426.	0
7	15	15	The given sequence increases by 2 each time. Starting from 7: 7 + 2 = 9, 9 + 2 = 11, 11 + 2 = 13. Following this pattern, the next number would be 13 + 2 = 15.	0
8	12405	12357	"The sequence shows a pattern of multiplying the previous number by an increasing integer and adding a specific incremental pattern. To break it down: 
- 5 * 7 + 1 = 36 
- 36 * 7 + 1 = 253 
- 253 * 7 + 1 = 1772 
Continuing this pattern, 1772 * 7 + 1 equals 12357."	0
9	486	486	The sequence is generated by multiplying the previous number by 3. Starting with 6: 6 * 3 = 18, 18 * 3 = 54, 54 * 3 = 162. Following this pattern, the next number is 162 * 3 = 486.	0
10	2400			1
11	65536	65536	The sequence follows a pattern where each number is the previous number raised to the power of 2. Specifically: 2^2 = 4, 4^2 = 16, 16^2 = 256. Continuing this pattern, we take 256 and raise it to the power of 2: 256^2 = 65536.	0
12	1806	1806	The pattern in the sequence can be found by observing how each term is derived from the previous one. Starting from the first number: 1, we multiply by 1 to get the second number, then we take 2, multiply by 3 to get 6, and then for 6 we multiply by 7 to get 42. Extending this pattern further, we can see that each term is achieved by multiplying the previous term by the next odd integer: (1*1), (2*3), (6*7). Therefore, to find the next term after 42, we will multiply 42 by 43 (which is the next integer in continuation of this pattern) to get 1806. Thus, the next number in the sequence is 1806.	0
13	10939557			1
14	10939556	1080000003	"The pattern in the given sequence can be observed as follows: 
1. The first number is 1. 
2. The second number is 6, which is 1 multiplied by 6. 
3. The third number is 56, which is 6 multiplied by 9 + 2. 
4. The fourth number is 3306, which is 56 multiplied by 59 + 2. 
To find the next number, we note the pattern of multiplication and addition. If we extend this to find a consistent multiplier for the next term, we find that this complex pattern results in a multiplication and shifting base. Observing from the previous numbers yields the next number in the sequence to be 1080000003."	0
15	31	31	To find the pattern in the sequence, we can look at the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are: 2 - 7 = -5, 9 - 2 = 7, 11 - 9 = 2, and 20 - 11 = 9. If we consider the differences as a new sequence: -5, 7, 2, 9, we see that the first three differences (-5, 7, 2) do not form a clear pattern initially. However, if we observe the last two numbers, we see that 11 + 9 = 20. Following the pattern, the next difference could be 11 + 9 = 20 (the previous was 20 - 11 = 9) leading to the next number being 20 + 11 = 31.	0
16	29	29	To find the pattern in the sequence 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, we can observe that each number is the sum of the previous two numbers starting from the third number in the sequence. Specifically: 3 (the first number) + 4 (the second number) = 7 (the third number). Then: 4 (the second number) + 7 (the third number) = 11 (the fourth number). Next: 7 (the third number) + 11 (the fourth number) = 18 (the fifth number). To find the next number, we add the fourth and fifth numbers: 11 + 18 = 29.	0
17	36	36	To find the pattern in the sequence, let's first look at the differences between consecutive terms: 6 - 2 = 4, 8 - 6 = 2, 14 - 8 = 6, 22 - 14 = 8. The differences are 4, 2, 6, and 8. Analyzing these differences reveals another pattern: the sequence of differences itself is 4, 2, 6, 8. The differences seem to alternate, and focusing on the even-indexed differences (2nd and 4th) gives us a pattern that can predict the next difference as 14 (summing the last two even-indexed differences). Thus, the next number is 22 + 14 = 36.	0
18	20	16	"To identify the pattern, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms: 
- The difference between the first (0) and second (4) is 4. 
- The difference between the second (4) and third (4) is 0. 
- The difference between the third (4) and fourth (8) is 4. 
- The difference between the fourth (8) and fifth (12) is 4. 

The differences can be summarized as: 4, 0, 4, 4. 
We can see that after the initial 4 and a repeat of the same number (0), the pattern returns to adding 4. Continuing this, the next term will be the last term (12) plus 4, which gives us 16."	0
19	40	40	The given sequence is derived by adding the previous two numbers together. The pattern is as follows: 5 (first number), 5 (second number), then 5 + 5 = 10 (third number), 5 + 10 = 15 (fourth number), and 10 + 15 = 25 (fifth number). Following this pattern, the next number is 15 + 25 = 40.	0
20	80	80	The pattern in the sequence appears to involve the differences between consecutive numbers: 8 - 4 = 4, 16 - 8 = 8, 28 - 16 = 12, and 48 - 28 = 20. The differences are 4, 8, 12, and 20. If we look at the differences of the differences: 8 - 4 = 4, 12 - 8 = 4, and 20 - 12 = 8. The second difference sequence appears to increase by 4. Following this pattern, the next difference in the first sequence should be 20 + 12 = 32. Adding this to the last number in the sequence (48 + 32) gives us 80.	0
21	56	55	To find the pattern in the given sequence, we can look at the differences between consecutive numbers: 8 - 3 = 5, 12 - 8 = 4, 21 - 12 = 9, and 34 - 21 = 13. The differences are 5, 4, 9, and 13, which do not form a simple arithmetic sequence. However, if we analyze the differences more closely, we notice a pattern: the differences appear to be alternating steps. The next difference after 13 can be expected to continue as an increasing pattern, leading to a difference of 21 (the previous jump being 13). Therefore, adding 21 to the last number in the sequence, 34 + 21 = 55 gives us the next number.	0
22	66			1
23	43	40	The sequence follows a pattern where the difference between consecutive terms is increasing as follows: 4 - 3 = 1, 9 - 4 = 5, 15 - 9 = 6, and 26 - 15 = 11. The differences themselves form the sequence 1, 5, 6, 11. Analyzing these differences, we see that they increase by 4, 1, and 5 respectively. The differences do not seem to have a fixed increment. However, the latest difference (11) can suggest the next difference may be 14. Therefore, adding this difference to the last term (26 + 14) gives us the next term in the sequence, which is 40.	0
24	59	51	To find the next number in the sequence, we first examine the differences between consecutive terms: 0 - 1 = -1, 9 - 0 = 9, 17 - 9 = 8, and 34 - 17 = 17. The differences are -1, 9, 8, and 17. Next, we look at the differences of these differences: 9 - (-1) = 10, 8 - 9 = -1, and 17 - 8 = 9. These second-level differences are 10, -1, and 9. Continuing this process leads us to observe that there is a quadratic relationship in progression. Therefore, the next number in the original sequence is calculated as 34 + (34 - 17 + 1) = 34 + 17 = 51.	0
25	1959	1855	The given sequence seems to follow a specific pattern derived from a polynomial relationship. Analyzing the differences between consecutive terms, we notice that: 1 to 1 = 0, 1 to 12 = 11, 12 to 67 = 55, and 67 to 364 = 297. The differences themselves have a pattern of increasing numbers which suggests a recursive relationship. By continuing this difference pattern, after 364, the next difference to add would be 1491 (364 + 1491 = 1855). Therefore, the next number in the sequence is predicted to be 1855.	0
26	966	1104	The sequence follows a specific pattern where each term (starting from the third term) can be computed as follows: the current term is multiplied by 2, then subtracting the previous term multiplied by 2 and the result is itself. More specifically: 6 = 8 - 2, 40 = 6 * 2 + 28, 102 = 40 * 2 + 22, and 328 = 102 * 2 + 124. Following this logic for predicting the next number, 1104 = 328 * 2 + 448. Thus, the next predicted number is 1104.	0
27	575	581	"To find the next number in the sequence, we can observe the pattern between consecutive numbers. The pattern involves multiplying the previous number by a certain increasing integer and then adding a specific value. Starting from 4: 

- 4 * 1 + 1 = 5 
- 5 * 4 + 3 = 23 
- 23 * 2 + 16 = 62 
- 62 * 3 + 8 = 194 

Following this pattern, we can predict the next number: 
- 194 * 2 + 8 = 581. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 581."	0
28	675	650	To find the pattern in the sequence, let's analyze the differences between terms. The differences are: 0 - 5 = -5; 5 - 0 = 5; 25 - 5 = 20; 130 - 25 = 105. The second-level differences are: 5 - (-5) = 10; 20 - 5 = 15; 105 - 20 = 85. The pattern of the differences suggests an increasing multiplicative pattern. Each term seems to be derived from the previous term multiplied by a growing integer. To find the next number, we can observe that the difference from 25 to 130 is 105, which means the next difference could be 130 + 5 * 65 = 650. Therefore, we predict the next number as 650.	0
29	1	1	The given sequence decreases significantly with each number. The first number, 91261, potentially represents a large initial value, but then the pattern shifts dramatically as it drops to 19 and then to 10. Observing the two changes: 91261 to 19 is a reduction of 91242, and 19 to 10 is a reduction of 9. Following this pattern of decreases, especially since the drop from 19 to 10 is reduced by 9, we might suspect that the next number could drop by 9 again from 10. Thus, 10 - 9 equals 1, leading us to predict that the next number in the sequence is 1.	0
30	9			1
31	3	2	The pattern in the sequence appears to be a declining sequence where each number is derived from the previous number through a division. Starting with 61023, if we apply a reduction, we see that 61023 divided by 5085 (approx.) results in 12. Then, similarly, 12 divided by 4 gives 3. Following this trend, if we divide 3 by roughly 1.5, we would predict the next number to be 2.	0
32	1	3	The sequential pattern can be observed by taking the digits of the first number, 70966, and summing them: 7 + 0 + 9 + 6 + 6 = 28. Then, the second number is derived by summing the digits of 28: 2 + 8 = 10. Following this pattern, the next number is found by summing the digits of 10: 1 + 0 = 1. However, since the numbers in the given sequence (i.e., 28 and 10) are subtracted from 28, the next expected value is 3 (10 - 7 = 3).	0
33	37	37	The sequence consists of prime numbers: 19, 23, 29, and 31. The next prime number after 31 is 37.	0
34	61	67	The given sequence is composed of prime numbers: 43, 47, 53, and 59. The next prime number following 59 is 61, and after that it is 67. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 67.	0
35	31	31	The given sequence consists of prime numbers: 17, 19, 23, and 29. The next prime number after 29 is 31.	0
36	17	17	The sequence is formed by taking prime numbers starting from 5. The prime numbers in the sequence are 5, 7, 11, and 13. The next prime number after 13 is 17.	0
37	43	43	The sequence consists of prime numbers: 29, 31, 37, and 41. The next prime number after 41 is 43.	0
38	128			1
39	113			1
40	187			1
41	128	122	The sequence follows the pattern where each number can be expressed as 2^n - 2, where n is an integer starting from 3. Here are the calculations for clarity: 6 (2^3 - 2), 13 (2^4 - 2), 30 (2^5 - 2), and 61 (2^6 - 2). Continuing this pattern, the next number would be 2^7 - 2 = 128 - 2 = 122.	0
42	85			1
43	4444	4444	The pattern in the sequence involves numbers composed of repeated digits, where each digit is repeated a number of times equal to its value. The first term is '1' (one '1'), the second term is '22' (two '2's), and the third term is '333' (three '3's). Following this pattern, the next term should be '4444', which consists of four '4's.	0
44	22	22	The pattern in the sequence can be seen by examining the differences between consecutive numbers: 4 - 2 = 2, 8 - 4 = 4, 14 - 8 = 6. These differences (2, 4, 6) are increasing by 2 each time. If we continue this pattern, the next difference would be 8 (6 + 2). Therefore, to find the next number in the original sequence, we add this difference of 8 to the last number (14). So, 14 + 8 = 22.	0
45	18	18	The pattern in the sequence is that each number increases by an incrementally larger amount. Specifically, the differences between consecutive numbers are: 9 - 8 = 1, 11 - 9 = 2, and 14 - 11 = 3. The differences themselves increase by 1 each time. Following this pattern, the next difference should be 4 (14 + 4 = 18), leading to the next number in the sequence being 18.	0
46	34	34	To find the pattern, we can look at the differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence: 7 - 4 = 3, 13 - 7 = 6, and 22 - 13 = 9. These differences are 3, 6, and 9. Notice that they are increasing by 3 each time. The next difference in the sequence would be 9 + 3 = 12. Therefore, the next number would be 22 + 12 = 34.	0
47	42	42	To see the pattern, let's look at the differences between each number in the sequence: 6 - 2 = 4, 14 - 6 = 8, and 26 - 14 = 12. The differences are 4, 8, and 12, which increase by 4 each time. Continuing this pattern, the next difference should be 12 + 4 = 16. Adding this to the last number in the sequence gives us 26 + 16 = 42.	0
48	52	52	To find the next number in the sequence, we can look at the differences between consecutive terms: 7 - 2 = 5, 17 - 7 = 10, and 32 - 17 = 15. The differences (5, 10, 15) form an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 5. Thus, the next difference would be 15 + 5 = 20. Adding this to the last term in the sequence: 32 + 20 = 52.	0
49	72	108	The pattern in the sequence is that each number after the first two is obtained by multiplying the previous number by its index in the sequence (starting from index 1). The sequence is as follows: 3 (index 1), 3 (index 2), 6 (index 3, which is 3 * 2), and 18 (index 4, which is 6 * 3). To find the next number (at index 5), we take the last number, 18, and multiply it by 4 (its index), which gives us 18 * 4 = 72. Then we multiply 72 by 5 (the next index), which gives us 72 * 5 = 360. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 108.	0
50	192			1
51	48	48	The pattern in the sequence appears to involve multiplication by an increasing factor. Starting with the first two numbers: 2 x 1 = 2 (1st number), 2 x 2 = 4 (2nd number), and then, 4 x 3 = 12 (3rd number). Following this pattern, the next operation would multiply the last number (12) by 4: 12 x 4 = 48.	0
52	1	0	The sequence appears to alternate between 1's and 0's with some irregularities. Analyzing the sequence, we notice three 0's appear towards the end after a single 1, suggesting a potential increasing grouping of 0's after each single 1. Given that the last number in the sequence is 0, it seems the pattern is stabilizing back to 0s after the preceding fluctuations. Continuing this interpretation, the subsequent number following the last 0 is expected to also be a 0.	0
