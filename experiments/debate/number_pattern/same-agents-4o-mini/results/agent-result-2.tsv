1	11	11	The sequence is increasing by 1 with each subsequent number. Starting from 7, the next number after 10, following the pattern of adding 1, is 11.	0
2	37	37	The sequence follows a pattern where each number increases by 9. Specifically, if you examine the differences between consecutive terms: 10 - 1 = 9, 19 - 10 = 9, and 28 - 19 = 9. Therefore, to find the next number, we add 9 to the last number in the sequence: 28 + 9 = 37.	0
3	19	19	The sequence increases by 3 each time. Starting from 7, adding 3 gives 10, adding 3 again gives 13, and adding 3 once more results in 16. Continuing this pattern, adding 3 to 16 results in the next number, which is 19.	0
4	27	27	The sequence increases by 5 each time. Starting from 7, the sequence adds 5 to get 12 (7 + 5), adds another 5 to get 17 (12 + 5), and adds 5 again to reach 22 (17 + 5). Continuing this pattern, adding 5 to the last number 22 gives us 27 (22 + 5).	0
5	4	4	The sequence consists of the same number, 4, repeated four times. There is no apparent change or pattern in the number itself. Therefore, the next number in this constant sequence will also be 4.	0
6	426	426	To find the pattern, we can look at how each number relates to its predecessor. The sequence goes as follows: 1 to 6 (1*5 + 1), 6 to 26 (6*4 + 2), 26 to 106 (26*4 + 2). Analyzing these multipliers and additive constants, we see that each term seems to be multiplied by 4 or 5 and then adjusted by a smaller constant. Continuing this reasoning, the next number after 106 would be calculated as 106 * 4 + 2, resulting in 426.	0
7	15	15	The sequence increases by 2 each time. Starting from 7, adding 2 gives 9, adding 2 to 9 gives 11, adding 2 to 11 gives 13. Following this pattern, adding 2 to 13 results in 15.	0
8	12405	12593	The given sequence is generated by a specific pattern: each term is derived from the previous term using the formula n * (n-1) * (n-2) + 2. Starting with 5, the calculations are as follows: 5 = 1 * 2 * 3 + 2; 36 = 2 * 3 * 4 + 2; 253 = 3 * 4 * 5 + 2; 1772 = 4 * 5 * 6 + 2. For the next term, we use 5 * 6 * 7 + 2 which equals 12593.	0
9	486	486	The sequence is generated by multiplying the previous number by 3. For example, 6 * 3 = 18, 18 * 3 = 54, and 54 * 3 = 162. Following this pattern, 162 * 3 = 486.	0
10	2400	2208	"To find the pattern in the sequence, we look at the ratios of the consecutive terms. The sequence seems to grow rapidly, suggesting a pattern based on multiplying and enhancing each term. Each term can be calculated as follows:

- The first term, 0
- The second term is 0 * 1 + 6 = 6
- The third term is 6 * 8 = 48
- The fourth term is 48 * 7.125 = 342

Following this empirical observation, the next term can be derived from the previous term:
- The fifth term is predicted as 342 * 6.44 = 2208 (using an observed ratio based on the previous growth factors).

Therefore, the next number in this sequence is predicted to be 2208."	0
11	65536	65536	The given sequence is 2, 4, 16, 256. Each number can be expressed as 2 raised to a power: 2 = 2^1, 4 = 2^2, 16 = 2^4, and 256 = 2^8. The powers increase as follows: 1, 2, 4, 8, suggesting that the next power of 2 in the sequence should be 16 (which is 2^4). Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 2^16 = 65536.	0
12	1806	1806	"The sequence can be observed to follow a pattern where each term is a product of the previous term and a consecutive integer starting from 1. Specifically: 
- 1 * 1 = 1 
- 1 * 2 = 2 
- 2 * 3 = 6 
- 6 * 7 = 42 
To find the next term, we take 42 and multiply it by 43 (the next consecutive integer after 42): 
- 42 * 43 = 1806. Thus, the next number is 1806."	0
13	10939557			1
14	10939556	1091222	The pattern in the sequence appears to be multiplying each number by a certain factor and then adding a number. The pattern is as follows: 1 * 6 = 6, 6 * 9 + 2 = 56, and 56 * 59 + 86 = 3306. To find the next number, we can observe that each multiplication factor seems to be increasing. If we follow this idea, we can predict the next calculation: 3306 * 331 + 2096 = 1091222.	0
15	31			1
16	29	29	The sequence can be understood by examining the differences between consecutive terms. The differences are: 4 - 3 = 1, 7 - 4 = 3, 11 - 7 = 4, and 18 - 11 = 7. The differences form the sequence 1, 3, 4, and 7. By observing the differences of these differences, we find they are increasing as follows: 3 - 1 = 2, 4 - 3 = 1, 7 - 4 = 3. The next difference can be predicted to be 11 (which is 7 + 4), leading to the next term being 18 + 11 = 29.	0
17	36	34	The sequence consists of numbers generated by adding the previous number with an incrementing odd number. The pattern is as follows: 2 (start), then add 4 (2 + 4 = 6), add 2 (6 + 2 = 8), add 6 (8 + 6 = 14), add 8 (14 + 8 = 22). The next increments are 10, so we add 12 (22 + 12 = 34). Thus, the next number is 34.	0
18	20	16	The pattern in the sequence appears to involve adding consecutive multiples of 4. The differences between the numbers are as follows: 4-0 = 4, 4-4 = 0, 8-4 = 4, and 12-8 = 4. However, when observing closely, the sequence can also be seen as producing additional 4s with a consistent increase. Therefore, if we continue the pattern as the last number (12) plus the next incremental count of 4, we get 12 + 4 = 16.	0
19	40	40	This sequence follows a pattern where each number after the second is the sum of the previous two numbers. Starting from the third number: 5 + 5 = 10, 5 + 10 = 15, 10 + 15 = 25. Therefore, the next number is 15 + 25 = 40.	0
20	80	80	The differences between consecutive terms in the sequence are as follows: 8 - 4 = 4, 16 - 8 = 8, 28 - 16 = 12, and 48 - 28 = 20. The differences themselves (4, 8, 12, 20) increase by 4, 4, and 8 respectively. The pattern in the differences suggests that the next difference should be 32 (following the increase for the last two terms of +8, +12, +20). Therefore, adding 32 to the last term 48 gives us 48 + 32 = 80.	0
21	56	55	The sequence appears to be based on the Fibonacci-like pattern, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Starting with 3 and 8, we notice that 3 + 8 = 11, which is not in the sequence but is followed by 12, a slight increment from 11. However, 8 + 12 = 20, close to but not equal to 21. Continuing: 12 + 21 = 33 (again, close to 34). Following this pattern, we find that 21 + 34 = 55, so the next number in the series should be 55.	0
22	66	57	To find the pattern, let's first look at the differences between consecutive numbers: 9-0 = 9, 12-9 = 3, 24-12 = 12, and 39-24 = 15. The sequence of differences is 9, 3, 12, 15. Analyzing these differences, we find that they correspond, in some way, to triangular numbers or a specific growth in differences. Let's calculate the next difference: after 15, the next difference seems to increase by an increment of 3 (the differences appear to represent patterns increasing in some irregular manner), suggesting the next difference might be 18 (15 + 3). Adding this to the last number gives us: 39 + 18 = 57.	0
23	43			1
24	59			1
25	1959	2025	The given sequence is generated by a pattern where each term is derived from the previous term and its position in the sequence: 1 (1st term), 1 (2nd term), 12 (3rd term = 1*12), 67 (4th term = 12*5.5833), and 364 (5th term = 67*5.4333). From the 4th to the 5th term, the multiplication factor slightly decreases. If we continue with this decreasing multiplication factor, predicting the next term as 364*5.5 leads to the next number being 2025.	0
26	966	1280	To find the pattern in the sequence 8, 6, 40, 102, 328, let's analyze the relationship between consecutive terms. The first observation is that the differences between consecutive terms seem to follow a certain rule. If we examine the relationship between each number and the following one: 8 * 0.75 = 6, 6 * 6.67 = 40, 40 * 2.55 = 102, and 102 * 3.22 = 328. The multipliers are not consistent, but it appears that the general increase is becoming more pronounced. It can be observed that the operation seems to be a combination of multiplication and slight additions or transformations. Continuing this pattern, we can multiply the last number (328) by approximately 3.9, yielding a predicted next number of 1280, aligning with the increasing pattern in growth.	0
27	575			1
28	675	780	To find the pattern in the sequence, let's analyze the steps between the numbers: Starting from 5 to 0 there's a -5, then from 0 to 5 is +5. From 5 to 25, we see an increase of 20 (which is 5*4), and then from 25 to 130, there's an increase of 105 (which is 25*4.2). The differences suggest multiplying by increasing factors: first adding 5, multiplying by 4 for the next step, and approximately multiplying by 4.2 for the step before the last increase. Continuing this multiplication pattern, the next factor appears to be 6 (increasing by approximately 1.8 for each). Thus: 130 * 6 = 780. Hence, the next number in this sequence is predicted to be 780.	0
29	1	1	The given sequence appears to follow a pattern where each subsequent number is derived by performing an operation on the previous number. Starting with 91261, if we consider the digits' sum: 9 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 19. The next number, 19, can also be analyzed by summing its digits: 1 + 9 = 10. Following this pattern, we now take 10 and sum its digits: 1 + 0 = 1. Hence, the next number in the sequence should be 1.	0
30	9			1
31	3			1
32	1	4	The relationship between the numbers can be seen as follows: 70966 minus 28 equals 70938, which reduces to two digits, 7 + 0 + 9 + 3 + 8 = 27, and then taking the sum of the digits of 27 gives us 2 + 7 = 9. When we subtract 10 from 28, we get 18, and adding the digits of 18 gives us 1 + 8 = 9. Hence, we can see that the numbers are reducing. Based on previous behavior, the next operation takes 10 and subtracts 6, resulting in 4.	0
33	37	37	The given sequence consists of prime numbers: 19, 23, 29, and 31. The next prime number after 31 is 37.	0
34	61	67	The given sequence is increasing by consecutive prime numbers. The differences between the numbers are as follows: 47 - 43 = 4, 53 - 47 = 6, and 59 - 53 = 6. However, each term beyond the first can be seen as adding the next prime number to the last number in the sequence. The next prime number after 59 is 67. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 59 + 8 = 67.	0
35	31	31	The given sequence consists of prime numbers. The numbers 17, 19, 23, and 29 are all consecutive prime numbers. The next prime number after 29 is 31.	0
36	17	17	The sequence consists of prime numbers: 5, 7, 11, and 13. The next prime number after 13 is 17.	0
37	43	43	The sequence consists of prime numbers: 29, 31, 37, and 41. The next prime number after 41 is 43.	0
38	128	122	The sequence follows a pattern where each term can be derived using the formula: next_number = current_number * 2 + 1. Starting with 6: 6 * 2 + 1 = 13, then 13 * 2 + 1 = 30, and 30 * 2 + 1 = 61. Following the same pattern, the next number after 61 would be 61 * 2 + 1 = 122.	0
39	113	113	The sequence can be observed as follows: the pattern involves multiplying the previous number by 2 and then adding a sequence of numbers: 2, 1, 3, 7. Specifically, we have: 5 * 2 + 2 = 12, 12 * 2 + 1 = 25, 25 * 2 + 3 = 54. Now, looking at the added numbers, they increase in a specific pattern (+2, +1, +3, +7). This implies a possible addition of 7, which relates to the previous differences. Therefore, 54 * 2 + 5 = 113 is the next term.	0
40	187			1
41	128	124	To find the pattern, let's look at the differences between each number in the sequence. The differences are: 13 - 6 = 7, 30 - 13 = 17, and 61 - 30 = 31. The differences themselves form a new sequence: 7, 17, 31. The differences between these new terms are: 17 - 7 = 10 and 31 - 17 = 14. The differences further correspond to a pattern where the increments themselves appear to increase by 4. If we apply this increment pattern to the last difference, we would expect the next difference to be 31 + 18 = 49. Therefore, the next number follows as: 61 + 49 = 110. Since we have an escalating difference, the next increment would logically fit the pattern resulting in 124 when calculated correctly with all steps considered.	0
42	85			1
43	4444	4444	The sequence appears to follow a pattern where each number is formed by repeating the digit corresponding to its position in the sequence. The first number is 1 (repeated 1 time), the second number is 2 (repeated 2 times), and the third number is 3 (repeated 3 times). Following this pattern, the next number would be 4 (repeated 4 times), which is 4444.	0
44	22	22	To find the pattern in the sequence, we can look at the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are: 4-2 = 2, 8-4 = 4, and 14-8 = 6. The differences (2, 4, 6) are increasing by 2 each time. Following this pattern, the next difference should be 8. Adding this to the last number in the original sequence: 14 + 8 = 22. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 22.	0
45	18	18	To find the pattern in the sequence, let's look at the differences between consecutive numbers: 9 - 8 = 1, 11 - 9 = 2, and 14 - 11 = 3. The differences themselves (1, 2, 3) are increasing by 1 each time. Following this pattern, the next difference should be 4. Therefore, adding 4 to the last number in the sequence (14) gives 14 + 4 = 18. Thus, the next number in the sequence is 18.	0
46	34	34	To identify the pattern in the sequence, let's examine the differences between the consecutive numbers. The differences are: 7 - 4 = 3, 13 - 7 = 6, and 22 - 13 = 9. We can observe that these differences themselves increase by a constant value of 3: 3, 6, 9. Following this pattern, the next difference should be 12 (9 + 3). Adding this difference to the last number in the sequence: 22 + 12 = 34. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 34.	0
47	42	42	To find the pattern, we can examine the differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence: 6 - 2 = 4, 14 - 6 = 8, and 26 - 14 = 12. The differences (4, 8, 12) form an arithmetic sequence where each difference increases by 4. Continuing this pattern, the next difference would be 12 + 4 = 16. Therefore, the next number in the sequence will be 26 + 16 = 42.	0
48	52	52	The sequence appears to be increasing based on a pattern in the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are as follows: 7 - 2 = 5, 17 - 7 = 10, and 32 - 17 = 15. These differences (5, 10, 15) increase by 5 each time. Continuing this pattern, the next difference should be 20 (15 + 5). Therefore, the next number in the sequence can be predicted by adding this difference to the last number: 32 + 20 = 52.	0
49	72	108	The pattern in the sequence can be identified as follows: the first term is 3, the second term is also 3. Starting from the third term, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by its position in the sequence (1-indexed). The third term (6) is 3 multiplied by 2 (the index of the term), and the fourth term (18) is 6 multiplied by 3 (the index of the term). Following this pattern, the next term in the sequence should be 18 multiplied by 4 (the index of the term), which equals 72. Thus, the next number in the sequence is predicted to be 108.	0
50	192	384	The pattern in the sequence can be observed as follows: Each number after the first two is derived by multiplying the previous number by an increasing factor. Specifically, starting from the second number, we can see: 8 (the second number) multiplied by 2 equals 16 (the third number), and 16 (the third number) multiplied by 3 equals 48 (the fourth number). Following this logic, to find the next number, we multiply 48 (the fourth number) by 4. Therefore, 48 * 4 = 192.	0
51	48	48	The pattern emerges from the following operations: Starting with 2, we have 2 (2 times 1), then 2 again (which remains unchanged), followed by 4 (2 times 2), and finally 12 (4 times 3). The rule appears to involve multiplying the last number by an incrementing integer. Therefore, the next operation will be 12 (the last number) multiplied by 4 (the next integer), yielding 48.	0
52	1	1	The sequence shows a pattern of alternating 1s and 0s. Observing the sequence, we can see that the occurrence of 1s is periodic, and they appear after a certain number of 0s. After the last three 0s, the next number in the sequence is anticipated to be a 1, as it maintains the established pattern.	0
