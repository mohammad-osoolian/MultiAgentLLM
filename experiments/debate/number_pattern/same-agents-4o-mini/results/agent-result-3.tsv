1	11	11	The given sequence increases by 1 each time. Starting from 7, the next number is obtained by adding 1 consecutively: 7 + 1 = 8, 8 + 1 = 9, 9 + 1 = 10. Following this pattern, the next number after 10 is 10 + 1 = 11.	0
2	37	37	The sequence adds 9 to each successive term. Starting from 1: 1 + 9 = 10; 10 + 9 = 19; 19 + 9 = 28. Continuing this pattern: 28 + 9 = 37.	0
3	19	19	The given sequence is increasing by a constant value of 3. Starting from 7, we add 3 to get 10, add 3 again to get 13, and add 3 once more to get 16. Therefore, continuing this pattern, we add 3 to the last number (16), which results in 19.	0
4	27	27	The sequence increases by 5 with each subsequent number. Starting from 7, we add 5 to get 12 (7 + 5 = 12), add 5 again to get 17 (12 + 5 = 17), and add 5 once more to get 22 (17 + 5 = 22). Following this pattern, the next number would be 22 + 5 = 27.	0
5	4	4	The given sequence consists of the same number, 4, repeated four times. There is no change in the value, indicating a constant sequence. Therefore, the next number in this sequence will also be 4.	0
6	426	426	The sequence appears to follow a specific pattern of increasing each term by a factor that grows exponentially. The differences between consecutive terms are: 6 - 1 = 5, 26 - 6 = 20, 106 - 26 = 80. The differences between these differences are: 20 - 5 = 15, 80 - 20 = 60. The pattern shows that the differences themselves are increasing by a multiplicative factor: the first difference is multiplied by 4 (5 * 4 = 20), and the second difference is multiplied by 4 as well (20 * 4 = 80). Following this pattern, the next difference after 80 would be 80 * 4 = 320, meaning the next term would be 106 + 320 = 426.	0
7	15	15	The sequence increases by 2 with each successive number. Starting from 7: 7 + 2 = 9, 9 + 2 = 11, 11 + 2 = 13. Following this pattern, the next number after 13 is 13 + 2 = 15.	0
8	12405	12411	To find the pattern in the sequence, observe the relationship between consecutive terms. Each number can be expressed as follows: 5 = 5^1, 36 = 6^2, 253 = 7^3 + 4, 1772 = 8^4 + 4. It appears that the arrangement is based on raising integers to increasing powers (starting from 1) and then adding a constant value of 4. Following this logic, the next term would be 9^5 + 4, which calculates to 59049 + 4 = 12411.	0
9	486	486	The sequence follows a pattern where each number is multiplied by 3 to obtain the next number. Starting with 6: 6 * 3 = 18, 18 * 3 = 54, and 54 * 3 = 162. Therefore, to find the next number, we multiply 162 by 3, yielding 162 * 3 = 486.	0
10	2400			1
11	65536	65536	The pattern in the given sequence is that each number is raised to the power of 2. Specifically, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 4^2 = 16 (which is 2^4), 16^2 = 256 (which is 2^8). So, following this pattern, the next number would be 256^2 = 65536 (which is 2^16).	0
12	1806	1806	The pattern in the sequence can be determined as follows: each number is the product of the previous number and its position in the sequence (starting from 1). Specifically: 1 * 1 = 1, 1 * 2 = 2, 2 * 3 = 6, 6 * 7 = 42. Following this rule, to find the next number we take 42 and multiply it by 43 (the next position), resulting in 42 * 43 = 1806.	0
13	10939557	108999999	To find the pattern in the sequence, we can analyze the relationship between consecutive numbers. The first difference is from 2 to 7, which is an increase by 5. The second difference is from 7 to 57, where the increase is 50. Next, from 57 to 3307, the increase is 3250. The pattern seems to suggest that each number can be derived from a recursive multiplication and addition. Specifically, 2 multiplied by 3 and then adding 1 gives 7; 7 multiplied by 8 and then adding 1 gives 57; and 57 multiplied by 58 and then adding 1 gives 3307. Continuing this pattern, we take 3307, multiply it by 3308, and then add 1, resulting in the next number being 108999999.	0
14	10939556			1
15	31	32	To find the pattern, let's examine the sequence. The differences between consecutive numbers are: 2 - 7 = -5, 9 - 2 = 7, 11 - 9 = 2, and 20 - 11 = 9. The sequence of differences is: -5, 7, 2, 9. It appears the next difference can be derived by taking the last two differences from this difference pattern: 9 - 2 = 7. Adding 7 to the last number in the original sequence (20) gives us 20 + 12 = 32. Thus, the next number in the sequence should be 32.	0
16	29	29	The pattern is found by looking at the differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence. The differences are: 4 - 3 = 1, 7 - 4 = 3, 11 - 7 = 4, 18 - 11 = 7. The differences form the sequence 1, 3, 4, 7. The differences between these numbers are: 3 - 1 = 2, 4 - 3 = 1, 7 - 4 = 3, which suggests the next difference will be 4 + 7 = 11. Therefore, the next difference to add to 18 is 11, resulting in 18 + 11 = 29.	0
17	36	34	The pattern in the sequence involves adding consecutive even numbers to the previous number to get the next one. Starting with 2: 2 + 4 = 6, 6 + 2 = 8, 8 + 6 = 14, and 14 + 8 = 22. The next should be 22 + 12 (the next even number) = 34.	0
18	20	16	The sequence appears to follow a pattern in which each term after the first two is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms are 0 and 4, so 0 + 4 = 4 (which is the third term). The next terms are computed as follows: 4 + 4 = 8 (fourth term), and 4 + 8 = 12 (fifth term). Continuing this pattern, the next term is 8 + 12 = 20.	0
19	40	40	This sequence follows a specific pattern where each number (from the third number onward) is the sum of the two previous numbers. Specifically: 5 (first) + 5 (second) = 10 (third), 5 (second) + 10 (third) = 15 (fourth), 10 (third) + 15 (fourth) = 25 (fifth). Continuing this pattern, we take the last two numbers: 15 (fourth) + 25 (fifth) = 40 (next).	0
20	80			1
21	56	55	The pattern in the sequence can be derived by observing the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are: 8 - 3 = 5, 12 - 8 = 4, 21 - 12 = 9, and 34 - 21 = 13. The differences themselves (5, 4, 9, 13) also show a pattern: they are increasing by 1, then 5, and then 4. If we follow the pattern of differences 5, 4, 9, and 13, we can see that the next difference should be 21 (13 + 8). Adding this difference to the last number in the sequence, 34 + 21 gives us the next number, which is 55.	0
22	66			1
23	43			1
24	59	68	To find the next number in the sequence, we first observe the differences between consecutive terms: 0 - 1 = -1, 9 - 0 = 9, 17 - 9 = 8, 34 - 17 = 17. Now, let's look at the differences of these differences: 9 - (-1) = 10, 8 - 9 = -1, 17 - 8 = 9. We notice that the second difference itself is forming a pattern: -1, 10, 9. The 'differences of the differences' are alternating, suggesting a potential regular change. Adding another 34 to the last difference of differences (17 + 17 = 34), gives us the next term in the original sequence as 34 + 34 = 68.	0
25	1959	1855	The pattern in the sequence can be observed by looking at the differences between successive terms. The differences are as follows: 1 to 1 (0), 1 to 12 (11), 12 to 67 (55), and 67 to 364 (297). The sequence of differences is 0, 11, 55, 297. If we look at the differences of the differences (second differences), we find: 11 to 55 (44), 55 to 297 (242). Continuing this pattern with the differences from the differences suggests exponential growth, where the next difference could be calculated as approximately 1.5 times the previous difference. This implies that the next term will be 364 + 1491 = 1855.	0
26	966			1
27	575	582	"The sequence exhibits a pattern where each number is derived by multiplying the previous number by an incremental factor and then adding an increasing integer. More specifically: 

- Start with 4: 
- 4 * 1 + 1 = 5 
- 5 * 4 + 3 = 23 
- 23 * 2 + 16 = 62 
- 62 * 3 + 8 = 194 
  
Following this pattern, we can derive the next number:
- 194 * 2 + 16 = 582 
Thus, the next number in the sequence is 582."	0
28	675			1
29	1	5	The sequence appears to be decreasing by a pattern related to the digits of the first number. If we divide 91261 by 10000, we get 9.1261, and then keeping only the integer part, we subtract 1, we have 9 - 1 = 8 which is disregards since next numbers are relatively smaller. If we look at 19 and 10, we see that 19 - 10 equals 9. The next number can be calculated by following a similar pattern of decrease, continuing with halving or subtracting, which leads to approximately 5 (after halving again from 10).	0
30	9	4	The pattern in the sequence involves dividing the previous number by 2. Starting with 36513, if we divide it by 2027, we get 18 (36513 / 2027 = 18), then 18 divided by 2 gives us 9. Continuing this pattern, 9 divided by 2 results in 4.5, but since the sequence suggests integer results, we can assume the next number would be the integer part of 4.5, which is 4.	0
31	3	1	The sequence provided appears to have a specific pattern formed by dividing each number by the previous one. Starting from 61023, when divided by 12, we get approximately 5085.25. Then, dividing 12 by 3, we get 4. Finally, dividing 3 by the last number 3 gives us 1. Hence, the next logical number in the sequence is 1.	0
32	1	2	To find the pattern, I look at the differences and relationships between the first number and the subsequent numbers. The first number is 70966, which is significantly larger than the next two numbers. A clear relationship isn't evident at first glance. However, if we analyze the numbers: 70966 corresponds to 28 in a certain form; dividing 70966 by a certain value leads us to a usable result, much like how dividing 28 leads us to 10. Continuing this pattern, we can assume that further division or reduction using the prior number leads us closer to 2, as it's consistently decreasing. Hence, I predict the next number in this sequence to be 2.	0
33	37	37	The sequence consists of prime numbers. The given numbers are 19, 23, 29, and 31, which are all prime. The next prime number after 31 is 37.	0
34	61	67	The given sequence is 43, 47, 53, 59. If we look closely, we can observe that each number is a prime number. The differences between consecutive numbers are as follows: 47 - 43 = 4, 53 - 47 = 6, 59 - 53 = 6. Following the pattern of prime numbers, the next prime after 59 is 61, but following the increasing pattern (up by 8), the next number after 59 would be 67, which is also a prime.	0
35	31	31	The given sequence consists of prime numbers. The numbers 17, 19, 23, and 29 are all prime. After 29, the next prime number is 31.	0
36	17	17	The sequence consists of prime numbers. The numbers provided are 5, 7, 11, and 13, which are all prime. The next prime number after 13 is 17.	0
37	43	43	The given sequence consists of prime numbers: 29, 31, 37, and 41. The next prime number after 41 is 43.	0
38	128	126	The sequence shows a pattern where each term can be expressed as: 6 (1), 13 (2), 30 (3), 61 (4). Observing the differences gives us: 7 (13-6), 17 (30-13), and 31 (61-30). The differences themselves (7, 17, 31) show a pattern as follows: the difference between them is 10 (17-7) and 14 (31-17), which suggests that the next difference may increase by 4 from the last difference (which is 14), leading to an increase of 18. Therefore: 61 + (31 + 18) = 61 + 37 = 98. Adding this next term gives 126 (the prediction applies a recursive growth pattern in the sequence).	0
39	113	113	The pattern in the sequence can be identified by looking at the differences between consecutive terms. First, we observe the differences: 12 - 5 = 7, 25 - 12 = 13, and 54 - 25 = 29. The differences themselves follow the pattern: 7, 13, 29. The differences of these differences are 6 (13 - 7) and 16 (29 - 13). We can see that these differences increase by a factor that suggests the next difference will be 16 + (16 - 6) = 36. Thus, the next difference after 54 will be 54 + 59 (29 + 30) = 113. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 113.	0
40	187			1
41	128	124	To find the pattern, we first look at the differences between consecutive numbers: 13 - 6 = 7, 30 - 13 = 17, and 61 - 30 = 31. The differences are 7, 17, and 31. Next, we observe the differences between these differences: 17 - 7 = 10 and 31 - 17 = 14. The second-level differences are 10 and 14, which increase by 4. Therefore, following this pattern, we add 4 to 14 to get 18. Adding this to the last first-level difference of 31 gives us 31 + 18 = 49. Finally, we add this to the last number in the sequence: 61 + 49 = 110. Thus, the next number in the sequence is 124.	0
42	85	85	The pattern in the sequence is that each number is derived from the previous one using a specific formula. The differences between consecutive numbers are: 8 - 3 = 5, 19 - 8 = 11, and 42 - 19 = 23. The differences (5, 11, 23) themselves appear to follow a pattern where the differences between them increase as follows: 11 - 5 = 6 and 23 - 11 = 12, indicating that the next difference should be 23 + 12 = 35. Therefore, to find the next number in the sequence, we add the last number (42) with the next difference (35): 42 + 35 = 77. Thus, the next number is 77.	0
43	4444	4444	The pattern in the sequence involves repeating the digit corresponding to the position in the sequence. The first number consists of one '1', the second consists of two '2's, and the third consists of three '3's. Following this pattern, the next number in the sequence should consist of four '4's, resulting in '4444'.	0
44	22	22	The pattern in the sequence can be observed by examining the difference between consecutive numbers: 4 - 2 = 2, 8 - 4 = 4, and 14 - 8 = 6. The differences themselves (2, 4, 6) form an arithmetic sequence where the difference increases by 2 each time. Following this pattern, the next difference should be 8 (6 + 2). Adding this to the last number in the original sequence (14 + 8) gives us 22.	0
45	18	18	The sequence starts with 8 and then increases by progressively larger increments: 8 to 9 is an increase of 1, 9 to 11 is an increase of 2, and 11 to 14 is an increase of 3. The pattern of increments is +1, +2, and +3. Following this pattern, the next increment should be +4, which means that 14 + 4 = 18.	0
46	34	34	To find the pattern, we look at the differences between the consecutive numbers in the sequence: 7 - 4 = 3, 13 - 7 = 6, and 22 - 13 = 9. The differences themselves (3, 6, 9) form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. Therefore, the next difference should be 12 (9 + 3). Adding this to the last number in the original sequence gives us 22 + 12 = 34.	0
47	42	42	To find the pattern in the sequence, we can observe the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are as follows: 6 - 2 = 4, 14 - 6 = 8, and 26 - 14 = 12. The sequence of differences is 4, 8, 12, which increases by 4 each time. Following this pattern, the next difference should be 12 + 4 = 16. Therefore, the next number in the original sequence will be 26 + 16 = 42.	0
48	52	52	To find the next number in the sequence, we first look at how the numbers increase. The differences between the numbers are as follows: 7 - 2 = 5, 17 - 7 = 10, and 32 - 17 = 15. We can see that the differences themselves form an arithmetic sequence: 5, 10, 15. The next difference would be 20 (adding 5 to the previous difference of 15). Therefore, the next number in the original sequence can be found by adding this difference to the last number: 32 + 20 = 52.	0
49	72	108	The sequence follows a pattern where each number is multiplied by an increasing factor. Starting with 3, we have: 3 (unchanged), 3 * 1 = 3, 3 * 2 = 6, and 6 * 3 = 18. The next number is obtained by multiplying 18 by 4 (the next factor), which results in 18 * 4 = 72. Thus, the next term in the sequence is 72.	0
50	192	192	The sequence appears to follow a pattern where each number after the first two is the product of the previous number and an increasing integer. The first two numbers are 8 and 8. The sequence can be described as follows: 8 (the first number) and 8 (the second number). Then, 8 multiplied by 2 gives us 16 (the third number), and 16 multiplied by 3 gives us 48 (the fourth number). Following this pattern, to find the next number, we take 48 and multiply it by 4, which results in 192.	0
51	48	48	The sequence appears to follow a specific pattern. The first two numbers are both 2, then the third number (4) can be seen as 2 multiplied by the index of the number in the series (2 * 2). The fourth number (12) can be seen as 4 multiplied by 3 (the index of the number in the series) which equals 4 * 3 = 12. Continuing this pattern, the next number would be 12 multiplied by 4 (the index for the fifth term), which equals 12 * 4 = 48.	0
52	1	1	The sequence appears to follow a pattern of alternating between '1' and '0' with certain sequences of three '0's. Specifically, the sequence can be broken down as follows: it starts with one '0', followed by one '1', then two '1's, and then sequences of '0's. After the three '0's, a '1' is introduced again. Thus, the next number after the last '0' should be '1' to continue the established pattern of introducing '1's after a certain count of '0's.	0
