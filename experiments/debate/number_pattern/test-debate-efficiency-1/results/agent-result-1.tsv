1	11	11	The sequence consists of consecutive integers starting from 7. Each number is incremented by 1 from the previous number. Therefore, following this pattern, the next number after 10 is 11.	0
2	37	37	The pattern in the sequence is that each number is obtained by adding 9 to the previous number. Starting from 1: 1 + 9 = 10, 10 + 9 = 19, 19 + 9 = 28. Following this pattern, the next number would be 28 + 9 = 37.	0
28	675	780	"To find the pattern in the sequence, we can analyze the relationship between consecutive numbers: 
- The differences between each pair: 0-5 = -5, 5-0 = 5, 25-5 = 20, 130-25 = 105. 
- The differences themselves (after the first pair) yield: 5, 20, 105. Now, the differences between these differences are: 20-5 = 15, 105-20 = 85. 
  - Continuing the pattern, we can see these differences seem to be multiplied by 4 or incrementally larger factors in a series. Applying the last difference to predict the next number: 130 + (130-25)*6 = 130 + 650 = 780."	0
