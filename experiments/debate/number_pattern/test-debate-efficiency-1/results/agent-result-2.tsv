1	11	11	The sequence consists of consecutive integers starting from 7. Each number increases by 1 from the previous number. Therefore, the next number after 10 is 10 + 1 = 11.	0
2	37	37	The pattern in the given sequence is that each number increases by 9 from the previous one. Starting from 1: 1 + 9 = 10, 10 + 9 = 19, 19 + 9 = 28. Following this pattern, the next number would be 28 + 9 = 37.	0
28	675	625	"The pattern appears to be that each number is derived from the previous number by multiplying it by a sequence of ascending powers of 5. Specifically: 
- 5 * 0 = 0 
- 0 * 5 = 0 (but adding the previous 5 gives 5)
- 5 * 5 = 25 
- 5 * 25 = 125 + 5 = 130
To continue this pattern, we take the last number (130) and multiply it by 5, and then it appears to relate to the previous context by adding 5, which results in 625."	0
