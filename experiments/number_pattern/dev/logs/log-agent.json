From 91261 to 19, the number decreases drastically, but when considering the relationship with 19 to 10, it can be seen that we subtract 9 (19 - 9 = 10). Therefore, to find the next number in relation to 10, we can subtract 5 (10 - 5 = 5), which suggests the next number would be 5.\"\n}"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n   \"next_number\": \"650\",\n   \"explanation\": \"To find the pattern, we can look at the differences and the potential operations applied to the numbers. The differences are as follows: 0 - 5 = -5, 5 - 0 = 5, 25 - 5 = 20, and 130 - 25 = 105. If we observe these differences: -5, 5, 20, 105, we find that they don't follow a simple arithmetic progression. Looking further, it's possible to notice that each number (after the first two) is getting roughly multiplied and adjusted. Specifically, observe that 130 is approximately (25 * 5) + 5. Following this logic, if we assume that the subsequent number will follow a similar multiplication -, we can approximate the next number as (130 * 5) - 5 = 650.\"\n}"}
