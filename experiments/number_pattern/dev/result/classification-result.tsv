1	11	0	11	The sequence consists of consecutive integers starting from 7. Each number in the sequence increases by 1 from the previous number. Therefore, the next number after 10 is 11.
2	37	0	37	The pattern in the sequence can be observed by looking at the differences between consecutive numbers. The differences are as follows: 10 - 1 = 9, 19 - 10 = 9, and 28 - 19 = 9. This shows that each number is increasing by 9. To find the next number, we add 9 to the last number (28), which gives us 37.
28	675	0	650	To find the pattern, we can look at the differences and the potential operations applied to the numbers. The differences are as follows: 0 - 5 = -5, 5 - 0 = 5, 25 - 5 = 20, and 130 - 25 = 105. If we observe these differences: -5, 5, 20, 105, we find that they don't follow a simple arithmetic progression. Looking further, it's possible to notice that each number (after the first two) is getting roughly multiplied and adjusted. Specifically, observe that 130 is approximately (25 * 5) + 5. Following this logic, if we assume that the subsequent number will follow a similar multiplication -, we can approximate the next number as (130 * 5) - 5 = 650.
29	1	0	5	The sequence appears to be reducing by a consistent pattern in an alternating fashion. From 91261 to 19, the number decreases drastically, but when considering the relationship with 19 to 10, it can be seen that we subtract 9 (19 - 9 = 10). Therefore, to find the next number in relation to 10, we can subtract 5 (10 - 5 = 5), which suggests the next number would be 5.
3	19	0	19	The pattern in the sequence is that each number is increased by 3 from the previous number. Starting from 7, we add 3 to get 10, then add 3 again to get 13, and add 3 once more to get 16. Continuing this pattern, adding 3 to 16 gives us 19.
