{"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n   \"next_number\": \"1300\",\n   \"explanation\": \"The pattern can be observed as follows: each term in the sequence seems to be related to its position in a specific way. Starting with 5 (1st term), then 0 (2nd term, which is 5 * 0), then 5 (3rd term, which is the previous term 0 added by 5), the 4th term is 25 (which is 5^2), and the 5th term is 130 (which can be considered as 130 = 5 * 25 + 5). This hints at an increasing exponential-like relationship. If we follow the pattern, we can deduce that the next number should be derived from a similar operation: predicting that 130 will be multiplied by 10 gives us 1300 for the next number.\"\n}"}
