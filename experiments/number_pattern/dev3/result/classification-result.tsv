1	11	0	11	The given sequence of numbers is increasing by 1 each time (7 + 1 = 8, 8 + 1 = 9, 9 + 1 = 10). Following this pattern, the next number after 10 should be 10 + 1, which equals 11.
2	37	0	37	The pattern in the given sequence is that each number increases by 9 sequentially. Specifically: 10 - 1 = 9, 19 - 10 = 9, 28 - 19 = 9. Continuing this pattern, we add 9 to the last number, 28, which gives us 28 + 9 = 37.
28	675	0	1300	The pattern can be observed as follows: each term in the sequence seems to be related to its position in a specific way. Starting with 5 (1st term), then 0 (2nd term, which is 5 * 0), then 5 (3rd term, which is the previous term 0 added by 5), the 4th term is 25 (which is 5^2), and the 5th term is 130 (which can be considered as 130 = 5 * 25 + 5). This hints at an increasing exponential-like relationship. If we follow the pattern, we can deduce that the next number should be derived from a similar operation: predicting that 130 will be multiplied by 10 gives us 1300 for the next number.
29	1	0	1	The sequence seems to represent the sum of digits of the previous number. Starting with 91261, the digits add up to 9 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 19. Next, for 19, the sum of its digits is 1 + 9 = 10. Then, for 10, the sum of the digits is 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, the predicted next number in the sequence is 1.
3	19	0	19	The given sequence increases by 3 each time. Starting from 7: 7 + 3 = 10, 10 + 3 = 13, and 13 + 3 = 16. Following this pattern, the next number would be 16 + 3 = 19.
